Ghee is an Aarakocra scholar focused on the study of death. They have long lived in isolation within the Aarakocra Archives, dedicated to understanding the end of life. While others avoid the subject, I examine it closely. Death is a natural part of existence, and their work is to learn all that they can about it.

Ghee's uncle, the duke of Zamekpior, was the next heir to the throne but vanished unexpectedly! Ghee follows the book "Fecchin's autobiography" which guides them to him.

- Ghee admires Beauty. For what is beautiful points us beyond itself toward what is true.
- They have been searching their whole life for the answer to a certain question....
- Most people scream and run when they see a demon. Ghee, however, stops and takes notes on its anatomy.
