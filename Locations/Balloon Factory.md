# Balloon Factory

A factory in [[Downfall]] where balloons are made. It was slightly aflame when the party arrived, with small neverending flames caused by [[Kiiki]], an animated coal.

## Staff
[[Duke Ickrind]] was the last remaining Bullywug working here after his entire dukedom perished trying to fend off the fires. He was toiling slowly and bored, throwing buckets of water against the flames.

## History
[[Sir Morgort]]'s group snatched [[Kiiki]] from [[Bavlorna's Cottage]] and left it here to burn the factory down as a distraction during their rescue of [[Sir Talavar]].

The party assisted [[Duke Ickrind]] and discovered [[Kiiki]] was causing the sparks. They ended up adopting the animated coal.

[[King Bullog IX]] gave the party accommodation here.

## The Revolution
[[Snailbrain]] the goblin pirate was found hiding behind a tree near the factory. The party lured her into the revolution with the promise of all the balloons in the factory.
