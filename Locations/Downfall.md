# Downfall

The home of the Bullywugs in [[Hither]], a murky swamp surrounded by shabby shacks and wooden huts. [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]'s cottage sits in the middle of Downfall, though she was rarely seen outside.

## Notable Locations
- [[Soggy Court]] - [[King Bullog IX]]'s court
- [[Balloon Factory]] - Where [[Duke Ickrind]] worked
- The Prison - Where [[Sir Morgort]] was held
- Bridge of Decapitated Heads - Where [[Clapperclaw]] was found

- [[Baron Illig]]'s hideout - Secret meeting hall for the coup

## Access
Finding Downfall is difficult without knowing the path. There are two known routes:
1. Through the [[Bandit's Tollway]] (dangerous)
2. Following a secret water stream through the fog

The party found it by following giant tadpoles through the flooded area with [[Leneus]] riding one.

## History
The party arrived and was welcomed by [[King Bullog IX]], who gave them accommodation in the [[Balloon Factory]].

A revolution was organized using [[Baron Illig]]'s forces (after the party kidnapped the Baron). The king was overthrown and beheaded using a makeshift guillotine. [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] appeared demanding a new king be chosen, but the party infiltrated her cottage and defeated her, liberating [[Hither]].
