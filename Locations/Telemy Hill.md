# Telemy Hill

A moving hill covered with several withered trees far to the east of [[Hither]]. Visitors cannot land on the top directly as the hill shifts its top with trees, so they must land at the foot and climb up.

## Inhabitants
- [[Jingle Jangle]] - A goblin who lives in a cave shaped like a key at the top of the hill
- Five Weeping Willows - Friendly trees that greet visitors and show them the way

## Events
[[Argon]] and [[Alex Jones]] came here seeking the key to [[Sir Talavar]]'s cage. The Willows showed them to [[Jingle Jangle]]'s abode.

After [[Alex Jones]] spent time with [[Jingle Jangle]] and cheered her up, all of the Weeping Willows started dancing, leaves grew on their branches, and birds and crickets were heard. One tree danced around [[Argon]] and gave him a key with the message:

*"A FUTURE DOOR THIS KEY FITS IN, WHERE THE HAG KEEPS HER KIN"*

[[Jingle Jangle]] provided information about [[Downfall]], [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], [[Clapperclaw]], and the [[Bandit's Tollway]].

The party rested on the hill and moored their rowboat at its foot.
