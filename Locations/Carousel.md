# Carousel

An attraction in the [[Witchlight Carnival]] operated by [[Diana]], a melancholic half-horse, half-human centaur. Rides cost one ticket each.

## The Painted Unicorns
[[Diana]] gave the party a bucket of gold paint to paint the carousel unicorns, which revealed secrets. The unicorns are in pairs with words: fortune and bold, pride and fall, stone and moss, stitch and nine.

The unicorns revealed:
- The original owners of the carnival are the three hags: [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], [[Scabatha Nightshade]], and [[Endelyn Moongrave]]
- [[Zybilna]] of [[Prismeer]], the Archfey, is frozen in time
- The three hags seized control of Zybilna's domain and split it amongst themselves, forming the Hourglass Coven
- The realms are called [[Hither]], [[Tither]], and [[Yon]]
