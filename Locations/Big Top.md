# Big Top

The central tent of the [[Witchlight Carnival]]. It has a huge arena-like interior where audiences climb up to find seats.

This is where [[Mr Witch]] and [[Mr Light]] make announcements and where the Crowning of the Witchlight Monarch takes place. [[Doug]] was crowned here and received the Charm of the Monarch, a small butterfly that grants the power of flight for one hour.
