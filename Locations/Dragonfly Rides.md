# Dragonfly Rides

A racing attraction in the [[Witchlight Carnival]] managed by [[Northwind]], a treant, and his companion [[Red]], a little red weasel.

During a race, someone or something scared a firefly, causing a dwarf riding it to soar towards the [[Big Top]] and nearly fall. [[Doug]] saved him, raising the carnival goers' spirits and relieving the staff.

After the ride, [[Northwind]] revealed to the party that [[Mr Witch]] and [[Mr Light]] aren't the carnival's original owners and aren't even from the Feywild.

[[Viro]] was found hiding somewhere near the Dragonfly Rides after running away from [[Dirlagraun]].
