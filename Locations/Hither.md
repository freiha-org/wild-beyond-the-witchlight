# Hither

One of the three realms of [[Prismeer]], formerly ruled by [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] until her defeat by the party.

## Description
A swampy realm cursed with frequent floods that reach 5 ft high and randomly come and recede. The party landed here on a huge broken highway to the south east after entering through the portal from the [[Witchlight Carnival]].

## Settlements & Locations
- [[Downfall]] - Home of the Bullywugs
- [[Telemy Hill]] - Moving hill where [[Jingle Jangle]] lives
- [[Leaning Tower]] - Where [[Sir Talavar]]'s balloon crashed
- [[Bandit's Tollway]] - Dangerous labyrinth guarded by Harengons and a giant rattlesnake
- [[Bavlorna's Cottage]] - The hag's flying lair in the middle of Downfall

## Inhabitants
- Bullywugs (formed a weird aristocracy since [[Zybilna]]'s fall)
- Harengons (turned into thugs by the hag, collecting memories)
- Giant serpents
- Merfolk
- Will O'Wisps

## Liberation
After the party defeated [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], Hither became greener, happier, and brighter. The grass grew greener, the waters became less murky, the animals grew cheerier, the mushrooms looked brighter, and the swamp became less swampy. Merfolk were spotted swimming across Downfall's lake.
