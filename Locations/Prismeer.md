# Prismeer

A domain in the Feywild ruled by [[Zybilna]], the Archfey, who is currently frozen in time.

## The Hourglass Coven
The three hags [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], [[Scabatha Nightshade]], and [[Endelyn Moongrave]] seized control of Zybilna's domain and split it amongst themselves, forming the Hourglass Coven. They distrust each other and are convinced that each sister is plotting against the other.

## The Three Realms
Prismeer is divided into three realms, each controlled by one of the hags:
- [[Hither]] - Ruled by [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] (defeated by the party)
- [[Tither]] - Ruled by [[Scabatha Nightshade]]
- [[Yon]] - Ruled by [[Endelyn Moongrave]]

## Rules of the Realm
[[Ms. Tumblestrum]] explained the rules of Prismeer to the party:

**Rule of Hospitality:** When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger enters your home, you are expected to be gracious and accommodating to them until such time as they prove, by their words or actions, undeserving of such hospitality.

**Rule of Ownership:** You must not steal from a friend, an enemy, or a stranger. To take something that doesn't belong to you without the rightful owner's permission is a crime and an unforgivable breach of etiquette.

**Rule of Reciprocity:** When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger offers you a gift, you are obliged to accept it and offer something of comparable value (be it a gift or a service) in return. Such reciprocation need not happen immediately.

## Access
The party entered Prismeer through a portal in the [[Hall of Illusions]] at the [[Witchlight Carnival]], guided by [[Ms. Tumblestrum]].
