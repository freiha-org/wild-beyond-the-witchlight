# Bavlorna's Cottage

The lair of [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] in the middle of [[Downfall]]. A barrier at the foot of the cottage prevents bullywugs from entering.

## Access
[[Sir Morgort]] described an entry from the bottom through the pool, below the waters, where a Gelatinous cube clogs the pipe. The party lured the cube away with brine and swam up.

## Layout
**First Floor:**
- B1: Main entrance chamber with pool
- B2: Room with taxidermied chimera animals

- B10: Tea room/living room (animated furniture, hidden lornlings)
- B12: Frozen meat locker (contained [[Octavian]]'s beating heart)
- B13: Butcher's kitchen (grumpy redcap revealed Bavlorna's weakness)
- B14: Balcony with cages ([[Vansel]] the Satyr was imprisoned here)

**Top Floor:**
- Bavlorna's dilapidated bedroom (black harengon hid under the bed)
- Secret room with [[Clapperclaw]]'s head, toys, musical instruments, a mannequin with magical helm, and a bronze frog statue (cursed wishing well)

## The Battle
The party fought [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], [[Charm]], [[Trinket]], [[Bauble]], a black harengon, and hundreds of lornlings here. During the battle, the lornlings detached the ropes tying the cottage to the ground, and it became a flying balloon structure. [[Argon]] delivered the killing blow to Bavlorna as she fell.

The cottage floated away after the battle.
