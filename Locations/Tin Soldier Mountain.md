# Tin Soldier Mountain

A large mountain in [[Tither]] with multiple redcap and tin soldier garrisons along three main roads leading to the peak.

## Defenses
- Redcap ambushes at various elevations
- Tin soldier garrisons
- Scarecrows with obsidian gem eyes
- Giant bats ridden by redcaps

## The Peak
At the mountain peak is a huge illuminated cave guarded by two tin soldiers. Inside:
- A massive pile of gold
- Deactivated tin soldiers
- A desk table with a big ledger
- [[Gib]] - A blindfolded old man tricked by [[Scabatha Nightshade]] to guard and count the gold
- A door leading to a room with a bed

Despite his blindfold and [[Dial Up]]'s invisibility, [[Gib]] was able to see visitors. He warned against robbing him and mentioned he used to be a person of interest in [[Baldur's Gate]] before having to leave suddenly.

## Events
The party fought their way up, dispatching multiple garrisons. [[Alex Jones]] died during an ambush when his shatter spell failed to trigger a rockslide and he was hit by a barrage of javelins.

The distraction allowed [[Skathach]] to escape from a redcap camp cage. One redcap escaped on a giant bat.
