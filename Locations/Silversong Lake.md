# Silversong Lake

A lake at the [[Witchlight Carnival]] where the final event of the evening takes place. A mermaid is suspended in a gigantic glass bowl in the middle of the lake, singing a beautiful entrancing song.

[[Candlefoot]] the mime was found here, entranced by the mermaid. As he listened to her sing, his black and white outfit turned bright and colorful, as if the mermaid's song had a magical effect on him.

The performance was interrupted when [[Kettlesteam]] the Kenku heckled the mermaid, causing her to break down in tears and retreat into her bowl. The party chased him down and discovered he had stolen [[Candlefoot]]'s voice.
