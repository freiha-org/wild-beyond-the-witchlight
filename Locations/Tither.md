# Tither

One of the three realms of [[Prismeer]], ruled by [[Scabatha Nightshade]], the oldest hag of the Hourglass Coven.

## Description
A realm full of fog and smog where visibility is limited to a few feet. It is very foresty and gloomy, covered by forests with mountains and hills of yellow sandstone and clay. The westward mountains are darker colored than those eastward. A large river is fed by several small rivers and merges into a lake.

[[Jimmy]] described it as very foresty and gloomy. There is a legend about [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] stealing [[Scabatha Nightshade|Scabatha]]'s thread of puppet making.

## Settlements & Locations
- [[Centaur Village]] - [[Goliolatrix]]'s settlement near the river
- [[Tin Soldier Mountain]] - Mountain fortress with [[Gib]] and the gold hoard
- [[Tin Soldier Factories]] - 5 factories where tin soldiers are made
- [[Floating Mountains]] - Where [[Zhengyi]] the ancient beast god sleeps

## Inhabitants
- Centaurs (being hunted to death or slavery)
- Tin soldiers (animated with fairy dust)
- Redcaps (lieutenants commanding tin soldiers)
- Fairies (enslaved for their fairy dust, turned purple/malicious)
- Dryads (attacked the party, calling them "corrupted ones")
- Blink dogs

## Scabatha's Forces
Hordes of tin soldiers guided by malicious redcaps chase centaurs day and night from the forests. The tin soldiers fight with spears and javelins but have trouble fighting without redcap guidance. The redcaps fight with scythes and basic magic.

Scabatha's factories use enslaved fairies for their fairy dust to animate the tin soldiers.
