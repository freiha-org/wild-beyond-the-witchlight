# Hall of Illusions

An attraction in the [[Witchlight Carnival]] operated by [[Candlefoot]] the mime, who charges a ticket for entry.

The hall is full of mirrors:
- Left mirrors show the future of each character that looks at them
- Right mirrors show the past

At the end of the hall, the party glimpsed a little girl with a pig mask who spoke in a gritty, crackling voice, promising to grant their deepest desires. She ran into the last mirror and disappeared.

## Portal to Prismeer
The very last mirror can become a portal to [[Prismeer]]. [[Ms. Tumblestrum]] guided the party here and spoke the words "Hither, tither, here and there, wonder yonder, show me where" to activate the portal. This is how the party entered the Feywild.
