# Bandit's Tollway

A dangerous labyrinth in [[Hither]] with huge 30 foot tall walls forming divergent and convergent pathways. A huge tree trunk sits at its center with a giant rattlesnake wrapped around it guarding the tollway and an unmanned ballista on top.

[[Jingle Jangle]] warned the party that this area is very dangerous - it was near here that she was attacked by Harengons led by a vile, black-furred individual who stole her happy memories.

## Defenses
- Giant rattlesnake whose rattle can deny flying and crash airborne travelers
- Harengon patrols on top of the walls, usually in groups of 2
- Arrow slit traps triggered by tripwires
- A tower in a small lake with two darkly garbed harengon guards

## Interior
[[Doug]], [[Leneus]], and [[Dial Up]] explored inside:
- [[Doug]] found an odd shaped stone with a face that opened an illusory wall
- Inside the hidden room was a treasure chest and a well stretching into darkness
- A friendly Sabertooth cat lived in one area
- The wells teleport those who enter them to other wells
- A Harelope (rabbit with antelope horns) helped guide them through the forest

## Later
After [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]'s defeat, the party looted the tollway and found it full of overgrowth and animal skeletons.
