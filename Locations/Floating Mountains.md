# Floating Mountains

Mountains that float far up in the east of [[Tither]].

[[Zhengyi]], the most ancient beast god that inhabits the realm, sleeps here. When [[Ghee]] made [[Owlie]] (resummoned as a giant chicken) breathe fire whilst flying up, fairies pointed and yelled "Oh its Zhengyi! It's Zhengyi!"
