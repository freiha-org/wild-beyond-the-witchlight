# Soggy Court

[[King Bullog IX]]'s court in [[Downfall]]. The party was escorted here by bullywug guards after arriving in Downfall.

To reach the court, visitors must:
1. Cross a pond of rocks, stepping only on particular rocks
2. Cross a bridge full of decapitated heads

The king welcomed the party here and gave them accommodation in the [[Balloon Factory]].

The court was the site of the revolution where [[King Bullog IX]] was overthrown and beheaded using a makeshift guillotine built by [[Alberto]] following [[Alex Jones]]'s blueprints.
