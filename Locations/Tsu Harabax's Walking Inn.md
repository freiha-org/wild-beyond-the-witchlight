# Tsu Harabax's Walking Inn

A walking inn in [[Hither]] operated by [[Tsu Harabax]], an elderly female human druid. The party heard a loud rumbling sound and saw the inn walking in the distance through the mist.

[[Tsu Harabax]] stopped the inn to let the party enter and offered them three beds and warm meals. She told them how [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] turned innocent and playful harengon into thugs.

When she learned the party wanted to defeat the hag, she offered her services for free to follow the rule of reciprocity. She also showed [[Leneus]] her druidic expertise and taught him how to turn into a few different animals.
