# Leaning Tower

A tower in [[Hither]] where [[Sir Talavar]]'s balloon crashed during his escape from [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]. The bottom of the tower is full of thick black brambles, and the balloon was perched at the top, hanging down.

## Dangers
- Two giant serpents nested in the tower - a red one with a fear-inducing hood and a green one with a rattle that grounds flying creatures
- No one near the tower is able to fly in, including [[Owlie]]
- The serpents wanted to trade [[Sir Talavar]] to the hag

## Events
The party found [[Wigglewog]] dead at the base of the tower. [[Argon]] and [[Wigglit Quibblefuzz]] used spider climb to reach the balloon and retrieve [[Sir Talavar]]'s cage.

[[Fudd]] made a loud exclamation that woke the serpents, leading to combat. The party defeated them after [[Ghee]] was swallowed whole and rescued by [[Argon]].

The party later dismantled the old swamp gas balloon from this tower to use for travel.
