# Tin Soldier Factories

A complex of 5 factories in [[Tither]], nestled among a large set of hills between two river beds. The terrain around them is burnt and ashen, with all trees cut down.

## Layout
- 4 smaller factories on the periphery
- 1 large central factory in the middle, next to a tin deposit

## Operations
[[Owlie]] scouted the larger factory and observed:
- Assembly lines producing tin soldiers
- Slaves working inside
- Redcap overseers

The tin soldiers are animated using fairy dust harvested from enslaved fairies. The fairies were captured and imprisoned for months, causing them to turn malicious and develop a dark purple/obsidian shine.

## The Party's Approach
The party decided to skirt the charred and cut-down areas, hiding behind trees. They found a group of redcaps and slaves cutting down trees at the edge of the forest and prepared an ambush to kill the redcaps and free the slaves.
