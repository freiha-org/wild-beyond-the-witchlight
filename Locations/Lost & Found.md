# Lost & Found

An area in the [[Witchlight Carnival]] watched over by [[Dirlagraun]], a playful Displacer beast who speaks only Sylvan.

[[Argon]] stole an executioner's hood from here on the first evening, feeling an ominous presence while doing so.

[[Dirlagraun]] watches over children here while their parents enjoy the carnival. Her cub [[Star]] vanished one night from the carnival and was never seen since - she keeps a small mirrored ball that belonged to Star.

The party helped return [[Viro]], a child who ran away crying after trying to take Star's mirrored ball.
