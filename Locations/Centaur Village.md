# Centaur Village

A primitive centaur village in [[Tither]] led by [[Goliolatrix]], a black-furred centaur with a golden mane. It sits near the river at the foot of the river south east.

## Description
A modest and crude settlement with nothing but basic hovels and longhouses with straw rooftops. A wooden palisade surrounds the village with two main entrances carved out in the east and west side. Around it is nothing but steppes and lightly forested plains.

## History
The centaurs fled their former homes in the wilderness and banded together to form this shabby but defensible village. They had no choice, being hunted to death or slavery by [[Scabatha Nightshade]]'s minions - hordes of tin soldiers guided by malicious redcaps.

## Notable Residents
- [[Goliolatrix]] - The chief
- [[Boudia]] - A heavily scarred survivor from a village to the north west

## The Party's Visit
The centaurs initially greeted the party with spears and arrows, but lowered their guard when they spotted [[Jimmy]]. [[Goliolatrix]] welcomed them and held a feast in their honor.

The party learned about [[Scabatha Nightshade]]'s forces and the fate of the centaurs from [[Boudia]].

[[Goliolatrix]] refused to let the party's balloon stay inflated in the village as it would draw attention from the hag's soldiers. They left it near the river entrance where the fog is thickest.
