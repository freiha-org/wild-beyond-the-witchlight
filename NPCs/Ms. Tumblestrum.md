# Ms. Tumblestrum

A small gnome who waited for the party after the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch. She revealed that she is the person who bought their tickets for the day.

Ms. Tumblestrum told them there is no time to lose and they must go to [[Prismeer]]. [[Mr Witch]] and [[Mr Light]] both showed her respect with a small bow each, but moved away as if not wanting to be associated with her.

She guided the party through the [[Hall of Illusions]] to the last mirror and muttered the words "Hither, tither, here and there, wonder yonder, show me where" which caused the mirror to transform into a vibrating colorful portal. She went through first and gestured for everyone to follow.

In [[Prismeer]], she invited the party to a bonfire at a broken bridge in [[Hither]] and explained the rules of the realm (Rule of Hospitality, Rule of Ownership, Rule of Reciprocity). She told them about the settlement called [[Downfall]] where they can find more information.
