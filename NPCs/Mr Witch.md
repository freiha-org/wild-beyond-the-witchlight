# Mr Witch

One of the two current owners of the [[Witchlight Carnival]], along with [[Mr Light]]. They are not the carnival's original owners and are not from the Feywild. The original owners were the three hags: [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], [[Scabatha Nightshade]], and [[Endelyn Moongrave]].

Mr Witch carries a watch that, if stolen, would delay the carnival's departure.
