# Goliolatrix

A black furred centaur with a golden mane who is the chief of the [[Centaur Village]] in [[Tither]]. He is armed with a well decorated longbow and a sturdy but beautiful spear.

Goliolatrix welcomed the party and [[Jimmy]], inviting them all to rest and dine with his people. The centaurs held a feast in honor of their new friends, where tales were exchanged about the situation of the land.

He explained that his people fled their former homes in the wilderness and banded together to form their shabby but defensible village near the river. They had no choice, being hunted to death or slavery by [[Scabatha Nightshade]]'s minions - hordes of tin soldiers guided by malicious redcaps.

He refused to leave the party's balloon inflated in the village, as it would draw the attention of the hag's soldiers, so they left it near the river entrance where the fog is thickest.
