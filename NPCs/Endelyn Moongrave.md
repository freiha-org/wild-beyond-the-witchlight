# Endelyn Moongrave

One of the three hags who were the original owners of the [[Witchlight Carnival]] and now form the Hourglass Coven along with [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] and [[Scabatha Nightshade]]. The three hags seized control of [[Zybilna]]'s domain and split it amongst themselves. They distrust each other and are convinced that each sister is plotting against the other.

Endelyn rules over the realm of [[Yon]].
