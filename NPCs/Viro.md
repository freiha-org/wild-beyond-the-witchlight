# Viro

A child who was playing at the Lost & Found area of the Witchlight Carnival with [[Dirlagraun]]. He attempted to pick up a small mirrored ball belonging to [[Star]], causing Dirlagraun to react aggressively and snatch it from him. He ran away crying and hid near the Dragonfly rides until the party found him and returned him to Dirlagraun.
