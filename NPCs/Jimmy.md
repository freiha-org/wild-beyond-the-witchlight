# Jimmy

The true identity of [[Clapperclaw]]. When the party placed the scarecrow's original head on his body, he transformed into a real human boy.

Jimmy suddenly remembered everything: the last thing he recalls is traveling with his family and being attacked, then killed by bandits on the road. He remembers his soul going through the hells before being snatched out and put in the body of a scarecrow. He had forgotten all this while he was a scarecrow.

Jimmy knows about [[Scabatha Nightshade]] and about [[Tither]], describing it as very foresty and gloomy. He mentioned a well known legend about [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] stealing Scabatha's thread of puppet making.

When asked if he had ever gone to the [[Witchlight Carnival]], he said yes, but it was a dark and somber place (unlike the carnival the party experienced).

The centaurs of Tither lowered their guard and welcomed the party when they spotted Jimmy with them.
