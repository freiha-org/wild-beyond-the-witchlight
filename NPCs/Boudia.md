# Boudia

A heavily scarred, battle worn centaur who watches the feasts with a sense of sorrow. She is the only survivor from a centaur village far to the north west of [[Tither]], nestled between two rivers and a series of hills and small mountains (near the [[Tin Soldier Factories]]).

One dark night, whilst she was out hunting, she came back to find her village in flames. [[Scabatha Nightshade]]'s tin soldiers and redcap lieutenants were everywhere with torches, swords and javelins. She barely escaped capture, powering through their blows and projectiles, running endlessly across the forests until she reached the plains. [[Goliolatrix]]'s centaurs found her and brought her in to heal and recover.

Boudia shared that the tin men have trouble fighting without the guidance of the redcaps, who fight with scythes and some basic magic.

She asked to join the party in their travels westward, wishing to bury, honor and avenge her kin. She used reflective words to convince some malicious purple fairies to renounce their mischievous ways, turning them green.

She guides blink dogs toward the [[Centaur Village]] for protection.
