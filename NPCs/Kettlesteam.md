# Kettlesteam

A Kenku who is a warlock of [[Zybilna]]. He lost his powers and does not know why. He came to the [[Witchlight Carnival]] to find out but the owners would reveal nothing.

Kettlesteam stole [[Candlefoot]]'s voice and decided to stay in the carnival and cause as much carnage as possible until the owners confronted him. He heckled a mermaid at [[Silversong Lake]], causing her to break down in tears.

The party interrogated Kettlesteam and coerced him into returning Candlefoot's voice. He promised to cause no more trouble after that.
