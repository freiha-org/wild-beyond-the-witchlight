# Bavlorna Blightstraw

One of the three hags who were the original owners of the [[Witchlight Carnival]] and now form the Hourglass Coven along with [[Scabatha Nightshade]] and [[Endelyn Moongrave]]. The three hags seized control of [[Zybilna]]'s domain and split it amongst themselves. They distrust each other and are convinced that each sister is plotting against the other.

Bavlorna took over the realm of [[Hither]] and lives in [[Bavlorna's Cottage|a cottage]] in the middle of [[Downfall]]. She is rarely seen outside her murky cottage. She turned innocent and playful harengon into thugs and tasks them with collecting memories - for every 100 memories they collect, she appears and gives them a pet.

She has hundreds of tiny replicas of herself called lornlings that serve her. Her cottage is actually a flying structure attached to fabric at the top.

**Weaknesses:** If someone runs around her in circles, she starts sneezing uncontrollably.

The party defeated Bavlorna in her lair. [[Argon]] delivered the killing blow by throwing a dagger that pierced her skull as she fell. Upon her death, rays of dark light gathered unto her falling corpse and it exploded into nothing. All of her lornlings simultaneously inflated and popped into puffs of swamp gas.
