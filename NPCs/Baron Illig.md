# Baron Illig

The Baron of Muckstump, a Bullywug baron who lived to the south of Downfall. [[Sir Morgort]] directed the party to seek him for answers.

The party gained entrance to his hideout through a letter of admittance obtained at a shisha lounge. His hideout contained a secret meeting hall housing a couple hundred bullywugs, all discussing preparations for an upcoming coup against [[King Bullog IX]].

Baron Illig gave a haughty speech about how ruling is his divine right, enlisting [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] as said divinity. He planned to simply install himself as the new monarch rather than mount a coup against the hag.

The party kidnapped and hid Baron Illig during the night. When everyone woke up the next day to find the Baron missing, the revolution proceeded without his leadership.
