# Clapperclaw

A scarecrow with claws for hands who was seeking to find his head back. His head (a gourd) was stolen by a band of terrifying looking harengons. He speaks with the voice and demeanor of a child.

The party found him on the bridge full of decapitated heads in [[Downfall]], conversing with the heads. [[Jingle Jangle]] mentioned he could guide travelers through the realm of [[Hither]] and into [[Tither]], but he had become elusive in recent times.

The party found Clapperclaw's original scarecrow head (with a stag's head illusion on it) in [[Bavlorna's Cottage|Bavlorna Blightstraw's]] secret room, on a mannequin. When they placed it on his body, he turned into a real human boy named [[Jimmy]].
