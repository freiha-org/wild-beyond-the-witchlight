# Duke Ickrind

A Bullywug duke and the last remaining Bullywug working at the balloon factory in Downfall after his entire dukedom perished trying to fend off the fires.

He was toiling slowly and bored, throwing buckets of water against the small neverending flames caused by [[Kiiki]], an animated coal. The party assisted him and helped adopt Kiiki.

Duke Ickrind revealed that [[King Bullog IX]] had arrested and killed a party of bullywugs that caused the fire and stole a prisoner from [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]'s lair. He mentioned that the sole survivor was a knight ([[Sir Morgort]]) imprisoned to the east.

During the election to choose a new king, Duke Ickrind came up on stage and pierced through the party's illusion of [[Alberto]], but agreed to their plan after they explained it.
