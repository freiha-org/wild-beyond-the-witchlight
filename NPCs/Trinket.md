# Trinket

A darkling who operates a shop with [[Bauble]] near the prison in Downfall. Their shop is housed under a huge storm cloud and sells foreign but also common trinkets and baubles.

Their elder, [[Charm]], was at [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]'s cottage working out some dealings with the hag.

Trinket wants to drain the color of one's eyes as payment for goods. Such are the ways of the Feywild.

Trinket and Bauble revealed that 3 weeks ago, a dwarf, an elf, and a tiefling were transported from Hither to Tither using their balloon (which is not for sale).

Trinket was killed instantly during combat in Bavlorna's bedroom when the black harengon caused a shockwave that hit both darklings.
