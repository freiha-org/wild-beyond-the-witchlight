# Dirlagraun

A playful Displacer beast who watches over the [[Lost & Found]] area at the [[Witchlight Carnival]]. She speaks only Sylvan.

Dirlagraun had a little cub named [[Star]] who vanished one night from the carnival and was never seen since. She keeps a small mirrored ball that belonged to Star, and reacts aggressively when anyone tries to take it.
