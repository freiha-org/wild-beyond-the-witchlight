A brave bullywug who drove [[Sir Talavar]]'s balloon during his escape from [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]. The balloon crashed into a leaning tower for unknown reasons.

Wigglewog was found dead at the base of the tower.

He was part of [[Sir Morgort]]'s group who helped break into the hag's cottage and steal Sir Talavar. Wigglewog stole a balloon and left Downfall with Sir Morgort.
