# Candlefoot

A mime at the [[Witchlight Carnival]] who is devoid of color and voice. He works at the [[Hall of Illusions]] and mimes to visitors about entering and the ticket cost.

His voice was stolen by [[Kettlesteam]] the Kenku. When listening to the mermaid sing at [[Silversong Lake]], his black and white outfit turned bright and colorful, as if the mermaid's song had a magical effect on him. The party later coerced Kettlesteam into returning Candlefoot's voice.
