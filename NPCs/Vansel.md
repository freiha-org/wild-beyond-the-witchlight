# Vansel

A nonchalant Satyr who was found enjoying the sun inside a cage on the balcony of [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]'s cottage.

He kindly asked the party to let him out. [[Doug]] opened the cage by force, and Vansel rewarded him and the other two who were nice to him each with a stick of luck (+1 to roll once a day).
