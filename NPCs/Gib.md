# Gib

A blindfolded old man found inside a huge illuminated cave at the peak of [[Tin Soldier Mountain]] in [[Tither]]. The cave is filled with deactivated tin soldiers and a massive pile of gold that Gib oversees. There is a desk table with a big ledger in front of him, and a door leading to a room with a bed.

Despite his blindfold and [[Dial Up]]'s invisibility, Gib seemed able to see him. He revealed he was tricked by [[Scabatha Nightshade]] to guard and count the gold in this room.

He did not seem hostile but warned Dial Up about robbing him. It seemed to the party that Gib was somehow connected to the Hag and to [[Baldur's Gate]], as he said he used to be a person of interest there and had to leave suddenly.
