# Bauble

A darkling who operates a shop with [[Trinket]] near the prison in Downfall. Their shop is housed under a huge storm cloud and sells foreign but also common trinkets and baubles.

Their elder, [[Charm]], was at [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]'s cottage working out some dealings with the hag.

Bauble wants to take away one's ability to dance as payment for goods. Such are the ways of the Feywild.

Bauble was killed instantly during combat in Bavlorna's bedroom when the black harengon caused a shockwave that hit both darklings.
