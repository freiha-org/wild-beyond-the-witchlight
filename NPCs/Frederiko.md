# Frederiko

[[Doug]]'s frog companion. Doug tried to use Frederiko to push [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] out of her pool so she couldn't rejuvenate, but that didn't work.

After the battle, Doug sent Frederiko to recover a bronze frog statue that had sunk to the bottom of the water. Frederiko offered the merfolk one of their stones, and they returned the favor by bringing the statue onto the shore.
