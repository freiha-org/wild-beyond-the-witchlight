# Scabatha Nightshade

One of the three hags who were the original owners of the [[Witchlight Carnival]] and now form the Hourglass Coven along with [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] and [[Endelyn Moongrave]]. She is the oldest hag among the coven. The three hags seized control of [[Zybilna]]'s domain and split it amongst themselves. They distrust each other and are convinced that each sister is plotting against the other.

Scabatha rules over the realm of [[Tither]], which is very foresty and gloomy. There is a legend about [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] stealing Scabatha's thread of puppet making.

[[Charm]] is rumored to be working for Scabatha.

Scabatha's forces include hordes of tin soldiers guided by malicious redcaps. They have been hunting centaurs to death or slavery, chasing them from the forests. She operates [[Tin Soldier Factories|factories]] in [[Tither]] where fairies are enslaved and their fairy dust is used to animate the tin soldiers.
