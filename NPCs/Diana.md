# Diana

A half horse, half human person (centaur) who operates the [[Carousel]] at the [[Witchlight Carnival]]. She wears a very melancholic look on her face.

Diana cannot reveal secrets from the carnival directly, but she knows something. She gave the party a bucket of gold paint and told them to paint each of the unicorns on the carousel to reveal secrets. The unicorns revealed information about the three hags, [[Zybilna]], and the realms of [[Hither]], [[Tither]], and [[Yon]].

She told the party to investigate [[Mr Witch]] and [[Mr Light]] in secret if they want to find out more.

## Location
