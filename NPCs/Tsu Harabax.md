# Tsu Harabax

An elderly female human druid who operates [[Tsu Harabax's Walking Inn|a walking inn]] in [[Hither]].

She stopped the inn to let the party enter and offered them three beds and warm meals. She told them how [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] turned innocent and playful harengon into thugs.

When she found out that the party wants to defeat the hag, she offered them her services for free to follow the rule of reciprocity. She also showed [[Leneus]] her druidic expertise and taught him how to turn into a few different animals.
