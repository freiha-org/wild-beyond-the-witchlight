# Zybilna

The Archfey of [[Prismeer]]. She is currently frozen in time.

The three hags ([[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], [[Scabatha Nightshade]], and [[Endelyn Moongrave]]) seized control of her domain and split it amongst themselves, forming the Hourglass Coven.

[[Kettlesteam]] was a warlock of Zybilna who lost his powers and did not know why. [[Sir Talavar]] came from the [[Summer Queen]]'s realm to [[Prismeer]] as an ambassador, intending to do diplomacy with Zybilna.
