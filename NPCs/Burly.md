# Burly

A Bugbear who works as staff at the [[Witchlight Carnival]]. He caught the party when they tried to enter [[Mr Witch]] and [[Mr Light]]'s wagon in the staff area.

Burly has a brother who is lost. He privately asked [[Alex Jones]] to try and delay the carnival by a day so he has a chance to look for him, because he knows that Mr Witch and Mr Light will leave on time otherwise. He told Alex Jones the only way to do this is to take Mr Witch's watch or Mr Light's vane.
