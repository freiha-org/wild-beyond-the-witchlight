# Jingle Jangle

A goblin who lives on [[Telemy Hill]], inside a cave shaped like a key. Her home is filled with several keys, and even her clothing is made of keys.

She was attacked and all of her happy memories were stolen by a group of Harengons led by a vile, black furred individual near the [[Bandit's Tollway]]. This left her sad and depressed.

[[Alex Jones]] sympathized with her and flirted with her. She found him charming, and they spent time together in private. Afterwards, the Weeping Willows on the hill started dancing and growing leaves. She became much happier and gave the party a bag of about 50 silver keys, one of which opened [[Sir Talavar]]'s cage.

She provided information about [[Downfall]]:
- [[Downfall]] is the home of the Bullywugs who have formed a weird aristocracy since [[Zybilna]]'s fall
- [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]] lives in the middle of Downfall but is rarely seen outside her murky cottage
- There is a scarecrow named [[Clapperclaw]] that can guide them through the realm and into [[Tither]]
- The [[Bandit's Tollway]] on the way to Downfall is very dangerous
