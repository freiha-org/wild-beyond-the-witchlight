# Sir Talavar

One of the [[Summer Queen]]'s knights. He came from the [[Summer Isles]] to [[Prismeer]] as an ambassador, intending to do diplomacy with [[Zybilna]].

During his daring escape from [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], his balloon driven by the brave bullywug [[Wigglewog]] crashed into the [[Leaning Tower]]. The reasons for the crash are unknown. Sir Talavar was held in a cage near the tower, guarded by giant serpents who wanted to trade him to the hag.

The party rescued Sir Talavar by retrieving the key to his cage from [[Jingle Jangle]]. He thanked them, giving them his sword which serves as a +1 dagger. He promised them another reward at a later point in time, and promptly flew away to the [[Summer Isles]].
