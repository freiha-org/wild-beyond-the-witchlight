# Mr Light

One of the two current owners of the [[Witchlight Carnival]], along with [[Mr Witch]]. They are not the carnival's original owners and are not from the Feywild. The original owners were the three hags: [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]], [[Scabatha Nightshade]], and [[Endelyn Moongrave]].

Mr Light carries a weather vane that, if stolen, would delay the carnival's departure. He tasked [[Alex Jones]] to keep an eye on new guests.
