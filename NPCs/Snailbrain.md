# Snailbrain

A goblin pirate discovered hiding behind a tree near the [[Balloon Factory]] in [[Downfall]]. The party lured her into their revolution with the promise of all the balloons in the factory.

Snailbrain visited [[Bavlorna's Cottage|Bavlorna Blightstraw's lair]] where she was introduced to [[Charm]]. The hag offered her a deal: in exchange for the soul of her captain, she would receive a balloon.

After the party helped save 8 pirates from lornlings attacking the sunken palace, the captain died (gutted by a lornling as [[Alex Jones]] and [[Argon]] carried him flying out). Snailbrain was devastated.

She returned to the hag the next morning. [[Charm]] revealed she had lied and was responsible for unleashing the lornlings on the pirate crew. The hag still wanted to make a deal but demanded the captain's body since his soul was gone. When Snailbrain said the body was burned as part of pirate burial ritual, the hag said it didn't look good for her.

Snailbrain is determined to slay the hag and help the party despite unfriendly comments from [[Alberto]].
