# Zhengyi

The most ancient beast god that inhabits Tither, sleeping far far up in the floating mountains in the east.

When [[Ghee]] made their familiar [[Owlie]] (resummoned as a giant chicken) breathe fire whilst flying up during a performance for fairies, the fairies pointed and yelled "Oh its Zhengyi! It's Zhengyi!"
