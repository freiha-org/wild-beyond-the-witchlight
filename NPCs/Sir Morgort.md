# Sir Morgort

A bullywug knight who appears as a normal but fit looking bullywug. She was imprisoned by [[King Bullog IX]] for stealing a prisoner from [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]].

Sir Morgort led a group of her subjects to break into [[Bavlorna's Cottage|the hag's cottage]] and steal [[Sir Talavar]]. They also snatched [[Kiiki]] the animated coal and left it in the [[Balloon Factory]] to burn it down. Everyone died during the ordeal except her and [[Wigglewog]], who stole a balloon and left [[Downfall]].

She was anxious and depressed about her scheduled trial by combat, afraid the unjust king would stack the odds against her. When the party offered to help, she told them to seek [[Baron Illig]], the Baron of Muckstump to the south.

She later described an entry to the hag's lair through the bottom of [[Bavlorna's Cottage]], below the waters, where a Gelatinous cube lies clogging the pipe.
