# Alex Jones

A pixie bard who works as a witchlight hand at the [[Witchlight Carnival]]. He was tasked by [[Mr Light]] to keep an eye on new guests but not dig too deep.

Alex Jones joined the party and traveled with them to [[Prismeer]]. He has a tendency to frequently blurt out lies and conspiracy theories. He stole [[Mr Witch]]'s watch before the crowning of the Witchlight Monarch.

He developed a romantic connection with [[Jingle Jangle]] on [[Telemy Hill]]. He also founded the RAF with [[Argon]] using radical Bullywugs in [[Downfall]].

Alex Jones died during an ambush on [[Tin Soldier Mountain]] when he was hit with a barrage of javelins after his shatter spell failed to cause a rockslide.
