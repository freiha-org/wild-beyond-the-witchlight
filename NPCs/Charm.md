# Charm

A tall Darkling lady who is the elder of [[Trinket]] and [[Bauble]]. She was at [[Bavlorna's Cottage|Bavlorna Blightstraw's cottage]] working out some dealings with the hag.

There are rumors that Charm is working for [[Scabatha Nightshade]], the oldest hag among the coven.

Charm has no shadow - her shadow is actually a separate entity that can carry objects. She was accused by Bavlorna of trying to enter her secret room and open her secret chest.

When [[Alex Jones]] confronted her about having no shadow, she panicked. A secret door broke open and her shadow emerged carrying a chest. During combat, after Trinket and Bauble were killed, Charm merged with her shadow and jumped out of the window with the chest, yelling "So long suckeeeeeers" as she escaped.

She escaped with her balloon and later lied about unleashing the lornlings on the pirate crew.
