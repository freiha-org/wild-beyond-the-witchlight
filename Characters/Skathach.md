# Skathach

A Darkling Elder who escaped from a redcap camp on the mountain in Tither. While the party fought redcaps and tin soldiers, the distraction was enough for Skathach to escape her cage in the redcap camp.

She escaped down the mountain and reached a formerly dispatched encampment, scavenging some of the remnants. The party met her on their way down and she offered to join them.

Skathach performed a puppet show for the fairies at an oak tree, which helped turn them from purple (malicious) to green (good).
