# Owlie

[[Ghee]]'s familiar. Owlie previously attempted to fly into the leaning tower but was unable to do so.

Ghee can resummon Owlie in different forms, including as a giant chicken. During a performance for fairies, Ghee made Owlie breathe fire whilst flying up, which caused the fairies to exclaim "Oh its Zhengyi!" referring to the ancient beast god.

Owlie is used for scouting, including exploring the factories in Tither's hills.
