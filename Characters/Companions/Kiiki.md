# Kiiki

A small animated coal that was causing sparks and neverending flames in the balloon factory in Downfall.

Kiiki was snatched by [[Sir Morgort]]'s group during their break-in to [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]'s cottage to steal [[Sir Talavar]]. They left Kiiki in the balloon factory to burn it down.

The party found Kiiki while helping [[Duke Ickrind]] fight the fires and ended up adopting the animated coal.
