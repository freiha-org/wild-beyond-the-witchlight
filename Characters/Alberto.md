# Alberto

A curious Bullywug hermit who joined the party in [[Downfall]] after overhearing them ask about [[Baron Illig]].

Alberto stood against the pirates when he discovered their plan to sack the sunken palace. He helped [[Snailbrain]] cross the dangerous pond to [[Bavlorna's Cottage|Bavlorna Blightstraw's cottage]], though a barrier at the foot prevented bullywugs from entering.

During the confrontation with Bavlorna, Alberto interrupted her speech and was immediately hit with a deadly cast of 12 magic missiles, falling unconscious.

The party tried to elect Alberto as a fake king to gain entrance to the hag's lair. They cast an illusion to hide how beaten down he looked, though [[Duke Ickrind]] saw through it.

Alberto ran around in circles counter-clockwise around Bavlorna during combat, causing her to sneeze (her weakness). He was later swallowed whole by the hag.

After the battle, Alberto helped open the locked chest from the hag's lair. He also failed to remove the giant snake's teeth when looting the [[Bandit's Tollway]].
