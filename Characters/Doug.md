# Doug

A member of the adventuring party. He participated in a gnome poetry contest with [[Wigglit Quibblefuzz]] and won some gifts. He saved a dwarf who was about to fall from a firefly during the [[Dragonfly Rides|dragonfly race]], raising the carnival goers' spirits.

Doug was crowned the Witchlight Monarch at the [[Big Top]] and gained a small butterfly called 'Charm of the Monarch' that gives him the power of flight for one hour.

He owns a frog named [[Frederiko]]. Doug worked on crafting snake teeth into a lance (with some damage in the process) and enjoys reading fey poetry.
