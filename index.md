## The Story So Far

The party first encountered the [[Witchlight Carnival]] while returning from [[Wytchway]]. What began as a night of wonder quickly turned into a journey through the Feywild when [[Ms. Tumblestrum]] guided them through a portal into [[Prismeer]].

### Chapter 1: The Carnival
The adventurers explored the magical [[Witchlight Carnival]], uncovering dark secrets about its true owners - the Hourglass Coven of hags. [[Doug]] was crowned the Witchlight Monarch before the party stepped through the [[Hall of Illusions]] into the Feywild.

### Chapter 2: Hither
In the swampy realm of [[Hither]], the party:
- Rescued [[Sir Talavar]] from giant serpents at the [[Leaning Tower]]
- Allied with [[Jingle Jangle]] on [[Telemy Hill]]
- Sparked a revolution in [[Downfall]] against [[King Bullog IX]]
- **Defeated [[Bavlorna Blightstraw]]** in her flying cottage

### Chapter 3: Tither (In Progress)
Now in the forested realm of [[Tither]], the party faces [[Scabatha Nightshade]]'s army of tin soldiers and redcaps. They've allied with [[Goliolatrix]]'s [[Centaur Village]] and are working to liberate the enslaved peoples of the [[Tin Soldier Factories]].
