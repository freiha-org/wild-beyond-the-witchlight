The Wild Beyond the Witchlight

# Prelude

During their return from Wytchway and the haunted mansion occupied by the Vistani Wereravens, the party composed of [[Ghee]], the Aarakocra wizard, Imuen, the “human” rogue, [[Argon]], the tiefling rogue, [[Leneus]] the druid, [[Fudd]] (Gurk) the Goblin, [[Wigglit Quibblefuzz]], the Harengon sorcerer, and the warforged monk named after an untranscribable series of sounds, notices flashing lights and bursts of fireworks in the distance, marking the enchanting presence of the Witchlight Carnival. As they make their way there from Grimsdorf, Imuen gets recalled back to Candlekeep to hunt with her brother, leaving the party for the time being.

  

As everyone arrives at the carnival very late in the night, they go to the ticketmaster to enter for an hour or two before it closes for the night.

  

## Chapter 1: The Witchlight Carnival

### The First Evening

Everyone is greeted in the carnival by this old looking goblin who introduces himself as Nikolas. He sells a ticket to each of the travelers, and gives a discount to some that take a small magical pact.  
The party enters the carnival afterwards, but finds out that there are only a few hours left before closure. They decide to visit the Big Top, the central tent, following the crowd.

After climbing up and finding a seat in the huge arena like inside of the tent, they spot two interesting figures in the arena, the owners of the festival: Mr Witch and Mr Light.

They go on to explain that the last event in the carnival is the Crowning of the Witchlight Monarch, but unfortunately no single carnival goer has changed the cheeriness and joy of the festival well enough to earn the title on this night.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc6LeGl5kMrwvre1zswFu8Zoa6pi_w5CRXrkXZXyVtzFjYyUoiAVPasIwHfOuMBS4glTV4Xk9WlQ7iy0fkb_1P0aGDrLZeWCD9M4JDCfy0eLDB54z0g7D1IFt4R_s8i0uNOWmnn?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

After the event, Alex Jones, the pixie witchlight hand bard working at the carnival was tasked by Mr Light to keep an eye on these new guests but don’t dig too deep! He joins the, and the party then does the snail race, visiting the pixie kingdom ride before leaving to camp outside. 

  
  

Before resting for the remainder of the evening, Argon decides to sneak into the carnival and steals an executioner’s hood from the Lost & Found, he however feels an ominous presence around him doing so…

### The Second Evening:

As soon as the sun set again the second day, the carnival opened its doors again. They start with the lost and found area.

  

There they interact with a playful Displacer beast called Dirlagraun, who, speaking only Sylvan, asks them if she can help hem with anything. She is watching over two children during this time, both of which are playing with Dirla merrily. Whilst asking Dirla about an executioner’s hood they had stolen the night before, one of the children, Viro, attempts to pick up a small mirrored ball in the area. Dirlagraun reacts aggressively and snatches the ball from the boy, causing him to run away and cry. She then begs the party to find the boy and return him, as she cannot leave her stand unattended. The party goes and finds Viro hidden somewhere near the Dragonfly rides, and upon returning him to Dirla, learns that the ball he tried to steal belonged to her little cub, named Star, vanished one night from the carnival and was never seen since. She used to play with that very mirrored ball Viro attempted to snatch. The carnival seemed cheerier afterwards somehow.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeK6bcyq8bSf9J1CuzZht-16HxtnF3eaHZtZoMAASPOrK-vZoFk2OnfG80165PyFNW9aqtFTGVXfgkrkNdA2Gg0GowyJ1ZJwwcbgL_EDEosp5k9InqSVVHymEGTsjtU4lW-snvV?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

Following that incident, the party goes to a giant teapot with bubbles coming out of it.

An interesting friendly goblin named Treaclewise kept speaking in rhymes and the party engaged with his rhymes and got Scatterleaf tea. The group participated in the bubble ride and each landed in a separate place. Argon landed near the Mystery Mine and went in, confronting his biggest fears. Doug and Wiglit participated in a gnome poetry contest and won  some gifts whilst Dialup and Alex Jones participated in goblin wrestling. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXerXHK8ldis-p3wUMag1kJroWV7rW0tx37M54LgMdjwYJiweKt5Gpzh-vThvOXUhyGSc3yliTwLa-K_4s1AlQmcU4XPsJa3WUGnHbsnWS9kIt2EKNJLmVoTy4Iview2ipKI27KtWw?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  
  

After that, the party noticed a gnome crying next to a weird statue that they noticed to be Tasha the wizard. And they realized that the gnome is probably crying from Tasha's hideous laughter spell being cast. The gnome Ween is with a partner, Rubin, who fled into the hall of illusions.

  
  
  
  
  
  

The party follows the gnome and as they enter the hall of illusions, they meet Candlefoot the mime, devoid of color and voice. He mimes them about entering and the ticket cost. The party asks Candlefoot about the gnome and he gestures that he hasn’t seen him, so they enter the ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf0GNT1RMMzeI5KzTe2IE53ATmd2f0odcy7u2ImIrSnD2QtMgpNdBeYuy8PUgDt1x7fn3_BRjPZEIsiCSqTh0WizRmfUcytYL8LOXL0qe4w5dbzsEARiSSHDw-yxh349SsMb-xF1w?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

hall of illusions. The hall is full of mirrors. With the left mirrors showing the future and the right mirrors showing the past of each character that looks at them. Once they get to the end of the hall, they hear a voice speaking to the gnome that they are chasing.

It tells them to follow them and to not be scared, it tells them that it will grant them their deepest desires. It’s a gritty and crackling voice. The characters barely had time to see what happened or 

who the mysterious figure was, they only glimpse a little girl with a pig mask running into the last mirror, which is just a normal mirror. And she disappears.

  

Leaving the hall disappointed and baffled, the party does dragonfly racing. Before the ride they talk to this treant named Northwind who has a little red weasel riding on his shoulder named Red, who is managing the ride.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeU26ODySrE_9Wra1NPciGAkuDt_Lqlp2Wf4RMSc17TaNQ5AzbWyF1N9H7SVxVonovGlF3cvujK3Zr2W37Q2SOmJylIT7h3dXftscCDHNcxoXY-OwGEvCpF7Hm-oQS1iTbvraUh7w?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

During the race someone or something scares a firefly and the dwarf riding it soars towards the big top, about to fall, but Doug saves him, Raising the carnival goer’s spirits and relieving the staff. After the ride Northwind reveals that Mr. Witch and Mr. Light aren’t the carnival’s original owners, they aren’t even from the Feywild!

  
  

The party goes to the Carousel afterwards where they find this half horse half human person called Diana, who wears a very melancholic look on 

her face.

  

She offers them to ride the carousel for one ticket each.

After they question her, they find that she can’t reveal any secrets from the carnival but she knows something. She gives them a bucket of gold paint and tells them to paint each of the unicorns and they will reveal secrets. The unicorns are pairs, which each pair contains the following words: fortune and bold, pride and fall, stone and moss, stitch and nine.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfR_nJkhhgBDhv4CZWdQPSwGLT3m1y6E2y8-SQdcvRc1DJuUQzaVwrS39l-MC4vWw--GUuHb-n5xJBhnzpButEGYn2pmZfi1_GhFzoQme_CaMHII7pvm_4ObKm0FhzKGsvvKZRkig?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

 The unicorns in order reveal to them that:

- The original owners of this carnival are the three hags: Bavlorna Blightstraw, Scabatha nightshade and Endelyn moongrave.
    

- Zybilna of Prismeer, the Archfey, is frozen in time. 
    
- The three hags have ceased control among Zybilna’s domain and splitted amongst them, forming the hourglass coven. They distrust each other and are convinced that each sister is plotting against the other.
    
- The realms are respectively called Hither, Tither, and Yon. 
    

Diana tells the party to go and investigate Mr. Witch and Mr. Light in secret if they want to find out more.

  
  

They go to the staff area and attempt to enter the main wagon that belongs to Mr. Witch and Mr. Light, but they find that it’s well protected by a wall of thorns and they get caught by Burly the Bugbear. Alex Jones gets told in private about Burly’s brother being lost. He asks him to try and delay the carnival by a day so he has a chance to look for him, because he knows that MR. Witch and Mr. Light will leave on time otherwise. He tells him the only way to do this is to take Mr. Witch’s watch or Mr. Light’s vane.

They all go to Silversong Lake where they attend the final vent of the evening, which is a mermaid suspended in a gigantic glass bowl in the middle of the lake, singing a beautiful entrancing song.ca They find Candlefoot the mime there, entranced by the mermaid. As he is listening to the mermaid sing, his black and white outfit turns bright and colorful, as if the mermaid’s song has a magical effect on him! However, in the middle of the song, an audience member 

heckles the mermaid and causes her to break down in tears and retreat into her bowl. The party chases the character and barely catches them to find out that it’s a Kenku that has stolen Candlefoot’s voice. 

  

They interrogate the Kenku called Kettlesteam and find out and find out that he is actually a warlock of Zybillna, and he has lost his powers and does not know why. He came to the carnival to find out but the owners would reveal nothing. So he has decided to just stay in the carnival and cause as much carnage as possible until they confront him. ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfafKweCBViiyg9OdUtTmdxa0r9ILeDmiOAKcMIcP9QwhyriNsJkGQaBa5jqNxQQp3h8SRzw3q3dQlKuDnmM7xkvD_2p3NBYzajWaF52gt0WUKqrUaxmYlKEAb_LcGu9Y-CQZplow?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

The party coerces Kettlesteam into returning Candlefoot’s voice. And he promises to cause no more trouble after that.

  

Alex Jones does steal Mr. Witch’s watch before the crowning of the Witchlight monarch. 

  

During the crowning of the Witchlight monarch, Doug gets crowned and gains a small butterfly called ‘Charm of the Monarch’ that gives him the power of flight for one hour. 

  

As they exit the stage, there’s a small gnome waiting for them outside. She introduces herself as Ms. Tumblestrum and reveals that he is the person who bought their tickets for the day. Ms.Tumblestrum tells them that there is no time to lose, they must go now to Prismeer. As she’s talking to them, Mr. Witch and Mr. Light both exit the stage, do a small bow each to Ms. Tumblestrum and move away as if not wanting to be associated with her, regardless of the respect they show her. Ms.Tumblestrum guides the characters through the hall of illusions, and at the very last mirror she mutters the words ‘Hither, tither, here and there, wonder yonder, show me where’. This causes the mirror to suddenly take shape into this vibrating colorful portal, shimmering with light and energy. Before the party can react, Ms. Tumblestrum goes into the portal. A hand comes out of it afterwards, gesturing for everyone to follow.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdnOng0_Kr1p3wfZ1LKvDRRJpGRyMguv02IT5wpMzMtFlS746cLKIlbPxBLHge13dj2Dv-tui5GKORgaiTGouCqK-wFuF3QOgNn0hnmc7i4-JzHK9gum93N1pTVdqMTjeDBmqUHgg?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## Chapter 2: Hither

### Day 1

  

The party follows her through the portal, and lands on a broken bridge in the realm Prismeer, to the part that’s named “Hither”. They take to exploring, and those with wings fly around the bridge to make sense of this new place. Ms. Tumblestrum invites them to the bonfire and offers them some food. She explains them the rules of the realm:

  

Rule of Hospitality. When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger enters your home, you are expected to be gracious and accommodating to them until such time as they prove, by their words or actions, undeserving of such hospitality.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfNKiYnqrRKbnURUeMhRivsZNno4A1BCY8tfuRFpreB3Oxg0_Lou9zUfUd6MwUjA9_ci0V7weZhRa0UgEOiPRWC_VRCWPbyIHfEQyw309Vy3gGu23FSKQVJl71jerLw1vvjHQaohQ?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

Rule of Ownership. You must not steal from a friend, an enemy, or a stranger. To take something that doesn't belong to you without the rightful owner's permission is a crime and an unforgivable breach of etiquette.

  

Rule of Reciprocity. When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger offers you a gift, you are obliged to accept it and offer something of comparable value (be it a gift or a service) in return. Such reciprocation need not happen immediately.

  

She also tells them that one of the three hags took over Hither and started turning the residents of the realm against each other, reaching havoc and chaos. She tells them of a settlement they can go to for more information, called “Downfall”. 

  

Having landed on the huge broken highway to the south east, each adventurer has to find a way down to the ground. Some climb down, whilst others fly. 

During this descent, Leneus notices something peculiar: A giant balloon crashes somewhere far away to the east, with clearly passengers on board. He continues down the highway with the rest of the party,  which makes its way down the broken bridge and starts walking towards Downfall.

  

On their way, they encounter a group of five Harengon, one riding a giant snail, supported by a flying pterodactyl.They seem to be hostile, and demand that the party give them their happiest memories. After a few attempts from Alex Jones and Wiglit to convince them that they are friendly, Argon attacks one of them, unaware of what is unfolding from his hiding spot, starting combat. They end up defeating all but 3 of the Harengon, and they take the leader hostage to question. He explains to them that the hag tasked them with the collection of memories, and for every 100 memories they collect, she appears and gives them a pet, which is how they got their snail and pterodactyl. 

They take the gourd of memories from the Harengon and let him go. After contemplating if they should continue with the memories in order to summon the hag, they decide to first gather more information about her. 

  

But first, East it is! Towards the Crashed Balloon!

  

As they are walking, they decide to stop at an empty burrow they see to rest. They sleep, gather their strength and before they leave, they check the door of the burrow to see if any water is on the other side, as apparently Hither is cursed with frequent floods that reach 5 ft high that randomly come and recede. After a knock on the door, the party realizes that there is indeed probably a flood happening, so they decide to wait an hour, and then another, when the floor recedes..

### Day 2![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf1D14SkI_QYeI95aijTkA-F8pQ-Uv56mfUivxcTbLrqaDvZIfHdxFiUwNfLIBZ6Fb9301HKdYNggpwLK-e_JcOW1NaUDNYnp1UTVLLeAhQBEoJZbSULnuLgCAu41nM-cIOK3YxHA?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

As the party continues their journey, they reach a very foggy encounter: a hobgoblin on stilts, carrying a basket full of eggs. 

Alex Jones, who is able to speak Goblin, asks him about the eggs, which he tells him that he trades them for goods.

  

They keep walking through the mist until they hear a loud rumbling sound, and eventually see in the distance a walking inn. The flying members of the group fly to the inn, and are greeted by the innkeeper, Tsu Harabax, an elderly female human druid.

  
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcZVQzVPMAGIFBNiRWp_VjCaEiZhjyt_6myutJ3SzEvsKCag2xJgYG9NYjcj1DvgH-EdJ17ZkncRzh-4-iG9NFgQ3XHioL_r0BCeSU83sC5B2kjen6vwiqe08OLAPPDr7Rvde__6w?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

She stops the inn to let the others enter, and offers them three beds and warm meals. She tells them how the hag turned innocent and playful harengon into thugs, and after she finds out that the party wants to defeat the hag, she offers them her services for free, to follow the rule of reciprocity. 

She also shows Lenny her druidic expertise, and teaches him how to turn into a few different animals.

  

After resting and eating at the inn, the party continues venturing and they come across a leaning tower. The bottom of the tower is full of thick black brambles, and at the top is perched a balloon, hanging down from the tower’s head. As they get closer, they hear someone whispering to them.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfTW-MjdTBz4H2XYZT7jOouR_AVP9E6OeSkVbg4EuUpp81k0e8PwEa9AvaYByxK6Ts08i0W-IOdF7dOdkGi-VK55j8UwyBF2RQT0uIDLHPJy3xDhARqUYFsS-DTDmaxdmRFnf8UpA?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

SHUSH! MAKE NO SOUND! THERE ARE GIANT SERPENTS SLUMBER!

  

It is Sir Talavar, one of the Summer Queen’s knights. He explains he has come from her realm to Prismeer as an ambassador, intending to do diplomacy with Zybilna. During his daring escape away from Bavlorna Blighstraw, his balloon driven by the brave bullywug Wigglewog crashes into this tower, the reasons unknown.

  

As everyone approaches the tower in silence, they notice a bullywug dead at the base, likely Wigglewog the driver. Argon and Wigglit use spider climb to walk up to the balloon, hanging from the tower’s perch. It seems that no one near the tower is able to fly in, as evidenced by their attempts and by Owlie, Ghee’s familiar’s previous attempts to do so.

  

They fetch the cave and take it down, and decide to move away from the tower. However, during this time Fudd makes a loud exclamation, and a serpent awakes and leaves the tower, waking the other one up in his way. 

  

Both Serpents are gigantic, their width each the size of a large door, their lengths that of the tower itself, they stride at inhuman speeds through the mud, surrounding the party and trapping them.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfL8q5KQhj-xluOK6eV3W5YYEldekgicRruy6SeFVVxDac4uG3E0F86J8L64cgNHATo_x2IdXaKh-fADkNBG2fUoFqULnNahp6hYqkrhYaSWgKG_4fM6an1peTFf_NUZMwujYBrIw?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

Leneus casts speak with animals and asks them what they want.

  

THE KNIGHT ISSSSS OURSSSSSS! WE WANT TO TRADE IT WITHHHHH THHHHE HAG! GIVE IT TO USSSSSSSS!

  

Being away from the tower, they realize that they should be able to fly now!

  

However, in a twisted shift of events, Leneus and Fudd (Gurk) froze and started T-posing, leaving the party with no easy way to communicate with the serpents.

This prompted them to discuss attack strategies against them. Ghee identified the snakes as two distinct giant constrictor snakes, the red one had a hidden hood that it can use to cause fear and the green one has a rattle that causes any flying creatures to sink to the ground.

  

Soon after, Alex Jones plays a soothing tune on his ocarina, causing the cobra to dance to it, but the other serpent ignores it and hisses in anger. This prompts Wigglefuzz Quibblefur to attack it using Chaos Bolt, starting combat.  
  

Using a combination of weapon attacks, charms and spells (one of which turns Quibblit into a sheep), they take down the two snakes, but not before one swallows Ghee whole! Argon manages to free him luckily, ending the battle.

  

Everyone spends the next hour roughly scavenging the beasts. Argon gets away with two nice slabs of meat and +1 darts, Doug and Ghee get together to pull out the serpent’s teeth, Dial Up and Alex tear away at the hood and pry off a scale, whilst Wigglefur avoids grazing on the grass but baaaaaahs loudly.

  

An hour passes and the current rises! They decide to abruptly run to the tower, carrying Sir Talavar with them. The party splits up here, Dial Up goes north to find a boat, tie it to himself and drag it back. Argon and Alex go east to find a Goblin Sir Talavar told them about, who might have the key to his cage. Ghee, Doug and Wiggle it stay in the tower with Sir Talavar and encounter a mimic on the last floor! But they decide to ignore it for now…![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdyWBXtNZQ7yYa9O9Jk4YXg9Mn2W3SWnvlTj4iB1nUfqL4ublU-X65Sai_L3WHp71Dt2zx8OjLay_DM-nuJsVq5ftEc2-8ZZncwXdcK7JjM8EYDyAMGh3RKpY3kNHw43fo105wG?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

Argon and Alex make it to Telemy Hill, the moving hill covered with several withered trees far to the east of Hither. They cannot land on the top directly, for some reason, the hill shifting its top with trees, so they land at the foot and make it up. Five Willows come to greet them in a friendly manner, and show them the way to Jingle Jangle the Goblin’s abode, on top of the hill, inside a cave shaped like a key. They enter to find a sad depressed Goblin pouting inside, her home filled with several keys. Even her clothing is made of keys!

  

She greets them with a sorrowful face, and asks them how she can help. She reveals that she was attacked and all of her happy memories stolen by a group of Harengons. However, unlike the Harengons the party has already met and defeated, these were led by a vile, black furred individual. Alex takes this chance to sympathise with her and reconcile her, then flirts with her. Jingle Jangle, intrigued, finds him charming. They then spend the next 20 minutes in private whilst Argon waits outside for them to finish. During the wait, all of the Weeping Willows start dancing! Leaves grow on their branches, birds are heard singing and crickets chirping. One tree dances around Argon and gives him a key…

  

A FUTURE DOOR THIS KEY FITS IN, WHERE THE HAG KEEPS HER KIN

  

Argon takes the key and meets Alex and Jingle Jangle inside again. Jingle Jangle, much happier, gives them a bag of about 50 silver keys, one of which should open Sir Talavar’s cage. They leave promptly, Alex Jones telling her he longs to see her again soon.

  

Once everyone makes it back, Dial Up from dragging the boat, Alex and Argon from Telemy Hill, a fight begins due to Argon smacking the mimic. It ends promptly with Doug getting swallowed and killing it from the inside. He extracts 400GP from the creature, and a gold necklace worth 60GP.

  

Sir Talavar is finally freed afterwards, but not before the key to his cage attempts to escape! Luckily Alex catches it promptly and uses it to unlock the cage. Sir Talavar then thanks the party, giving them his sword, which serves as a +1 dagger. He promises them another reward that he cannot provide at the moment but at a later point in time, and promptly flies away to the Summer Isles.

  

Remembering that Jingle Jangle might have information on Downfall and on an individual that might help them navigate the area, they decide to go back by their newfound rowboat. They row across what seems to be an ancient battlefield, where they pick up pieces of armor and weapons that materialize into animated armors, but these do nothing but sit silently on the boat. Once they exit the battlefield, the armors dissipate into dust….

  

Finally back to Telemy Hill, the party finds Jingle Jangle amongst the plethora of dancing willows. She greets them happily, but with a sadness still in her eyes. After being asked about Downfall and the Hag, Jingle Jangle revels to them that:

- Downfall is the home of the Bullywugs, and since the fall of Zybilna they have formed a weird aristocracy…
    
- Bavlorna lives in the middle of Downfall but is rarely seen outside her murky cottage
    
- There is a scarecrow named Clapperclaw that can guide them through the realm here and into Tither, but he remains elusive in recent times…
    
- The Bandit’s Tollway on the way to Downfall is very dangerous… it was near there that Jingle Jangle was attacked…
    

  

The party then decides to rest on the hill for the day, with their row boat moored at the foot.

  

### Day 3

Early in the morning, the party wakes up and prepares to head out to find Downfall. Jingle Jangle warns them that it is very difficult to find unless you know the path there! There are apparently two known ones, the first through the bandit’s tollway, and the second somewhere far to the east. Jingle Jangle knows that balloons keep flowing in and out, but never how…

  

The party then decides to attempt a journey by balloon, and decides to split up. 

Dial up and Alex Jones go south to dismantle the old swamp gas balloon on the leaning tower, whilst Ghee and Argon go search for swamp gas pits to fill it up.

Whilst flying south, Dial up and Alex Jones find a stream of water… they examine it and both see a weird reflection of a woman butchering some meat. Making nothing of it, they move on and dismantle the balloon successfully. Alex Jones sees it was damaged and decides to attempt some repairs, which go quite smoothly. After returning to Telemy Hill and tying the balloon to the rowboat they found earlier, they rest a bit and wait for Ghee and Argon.

  

These two, meanwhile, head west to check for swamp gas. They find instead on separate occasions two O’wells with trinkets at the bottom and a similar stream of water. Examining the stream, one of them sees the same woman butchering meat, whilst the other sees a headless scarecrow with claws for hands trying on different heads, until it settles for a gourd. They strike a little deal with some Will O'Wisps living inside different trinkets in the wells to take said trinkets: a tiny wooden unicorn with bright colors, a weird sundial, a notebook which seems empty but is not and a salt shaker shaped like a wizard’s tower

  

They split up for a brief moment, where Argon gets attacked by mud mephits and gets his rapier and shortbow stolen! Luckily Ghee dispatches one of them, which makes them drop the equipment and run away. They find a weird heart in the remains of the mephit’s corpse, filled with mud…

  

Going back to the slanted tower and searching south, Argon and Ghee find a swamp gas pit further south of the tower. They gather a sample of gas and test it out, and it works. Dial Up and Alex Jones join them and help them collect a bunch of gas and fill the balloon up, and Argon fills up sacks of mud and attaches them to the balloon as a counterweight.

  

Finally ready to head to Downfall, the party goes north west first, towards the supposed secret path. They find it suddenly ends with a very thick fog, and heading there leads them nowhere. Ghee hears a very faint sound of running water, which prompts them to double back and look for the entrance of the stream. They find it, it seems like the same stream of water that everyone has glimpsed visions from, and they deduce that following it through the fog would probably lead them to Downfall.

  

They decide, however, to go back east and check the tollway again as Alex Jones wants to avenge Jingle Jangle… As they enter the tollway’s vicinity they notice a huge tree trunk at its center, and another giant rattlesnake wrapped around it guarding the tollway. They decide to avoid its vision, knowing its rattle might deny their ability to fly and send them down crashing.

  

Skirting the edges of the tollway eastward and then north, the balloon gang finds a small lake with a tower in the middle, with two darkly garbed harengon with crossbows guarding the entrance. Whilst they tied the balloon to the mountainside overlooking the lake, Alex Jones rushes towards the tower and casts Shatter, on its nest, crumbling it and causing the harengon to fall. He then finishes them both off, just in time to stop one of them from sounding a horn.

  
  
  

They all take a small break to get the rest of the party out of the balloon, and then Doug, Leneus and DialUp enter the tollway.

As they proceed, they see huge 30 foot tall walls slithering into divergent and convergent pathways left and right, but the everlooming giant tree stump and its host snake are not visible from within the path…

  

Doug starts by going West. He find small paw prints leading to an odd shaped stone with a face on it, picks it up and pockets it.

  

Meanwhile, DialUp transforms into a crow and rushes into the main corridor of the tollway. perching at the end of it. To his surprise, the snake’s gaze snaps to him, still in crow form, and it shakes its rattle and lowers itself from the tree stump, showcasing a large, eerie looking unmanned ballista on top. The snake gestures its head and tongue towards a harengon on the stump, who looks at the crow and shrugs. Both go back to their posts, but not after signaling a couple of harengon to shoo the crow away.

  

DialUp looks around, and perched on top of several labyrinthian 20 feet wide walls are Harengons, in groups of 2 usually, patrolling the areas around them.

  

Doug and Leneus take the opportunity to walk into the tollway’s main labyrinth area, but to their dismay the entrance is trapped with arrow slits that they trigger by tripping on a rope! Panicked, they skirt the walls and use their staves to check the ground on their way in, attempting to avoid further traps. Doug finds an oddly shaped hole in the wall that incidentally fits the stone he is holding… He inserts it, revealing an illusory wall, which he enters alongside Leneus to find a cubic room inside the labyrinth's wall. 

  

They poke their head out the other side only to find a Sabertooth cat sleeping. Doug’s loud chainmail wakes the creature up, but it seems very friendly towards the both of them.

A quick glance around reveals a treasure chest and a well which seems to stretch eternally into darkness… Doug investigates the well by throwing a pebble and yelling into it… but soonafter a horn is sounded across the entire tollway, urging them both to hide inside the illusory wall just as the sabertooth cat says the Harengon are coming! Leneus, wanting to investigate the wells, turns into a spider and enters one of them, teleporting fully to a new well! He comes back safely to Doug, reporting his findings.

  

DialUp meanwhile, still in crow form, flies down and transforms, then turns invisible. He rushes across the area, dodging a trap, turning into a hybrid again and sneakily running naked next to two Harengons which fail to spot him in the confusion. He goes to the last area he had seen Doug and Leneus, and listens in on the Harengons speaking near him. They seem to be looking for them all...

  

He finds the illusory wall and enters, finding Doug and Leneus hidden there. They make the mistake of poking their head out, and soon enough, the Harengons surround them and threaten them, leading everyone to run out the other side, fall for the trap again and dive into the forest.

In the forest, they find and trail a Harelope, a rabbit with antelope horns. It guides them through until a grove where they find rest. Leneus communes with the forest to find it is scared… whilst Doug explores it and looks around.

  

Luckily, they find Ghee, who convinces them to leave the labyrinth and reach Downfall through the long way around to the west. The party then packs up and leaves, flying all the way around the tollway again and to the west towards the thick fog. The land unfortunately floods during this time, so they lose the secret water pathway to downfall, but Ghee cleverly dives into the water and finds some giant tadpoles, who guide them through with the help of Leneus riding one of them in the water.

  

The journey takes them to Downfall finally! A murky swamp, surrounded by shabby shacks and wooden huts. They are greeted by two bullywugs in the water, who escort them across the town into the King’s court. They cross a pond of rocks stepping only on a few particular rocks, followed by a bridge full of decapitated heads! They see a damaged balloon and a slightly aflame balloon factory on the way, before finally reaching King Bullog IX’s Soggy court, where he welcomes them and gives them accommodation inside the balloon factory.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd_R5jU0V-xpLPVEY2hqibGKEpn7-qLl4aiXtrYC8Do8E3IETCxiS2Cj7OZu7_Tq2MtT8YvC93Z0KzSIDYhnWmvH6rgFWqa-wZpL0v0wKSoAitLo0B96X1TJX_nfc8xLg19WNI0?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

There they find Duke Ickrind, the last remaining Bullywug working at the factory, after his entire dukedom perished trying to fend off the fires. He is toiling, slowly and bored, to throw buckets of water against the small neverending flames in the factory. The party assists him and spots a small animated coal named Kiiki that was causing the sparks, which they end up adopting.

  
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd1UaJnOULcVKyvHShanLtjwpaR4FCspcmapvcM4MIsP6b2-f9FH5Wxz2m41hM_r1e2we6Vw1Dk3UZwEoJrJgsbiZY_6peZHHKsHdvplWhdvjuvNe_0l5d0uX4q23hxFj9E31E3ow?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

The Duke, thankful, reveals that the King had arrested and killed a party of bullywugs that caused the fire and stole an important prisoner from the hag’s lair. Many of them died whilst one escaped with the last remaining balloon. And the sole survivor of the ordeal was a knight imprisoned by the king to the east.

  

The party goes to talk to them, but stops on the bridge full of decapitated heads, observing a certain scarecrow conversing with the heads. It is none other than Clapperclaw, the one they were told to find. It hoists a gourd for a head, and speaks with the voice and demeanor of a child. It reveals that it is seeking to find its head back… stolen by a band of terrifying looking harrengons. The heads reveal the same thing that Duke Ikrind has, that a knight was imprisoned by Bullog IX for stealing a prisoner from Bavlorna.

  

The party leaves the bridge for the prison to speak to the knight. Sir Morgort sits pouting in her cage, seemingly a normal but fit looking bullywug. She tells the party about how she and a few of her subjects helped break into the Hag’s cottage and steal Sir Talavar. They happened to also snatch an animated coal named Kiiki on the way, whom they left in the Balloon factory to burn it down. Everyone died during the ordeal but her and Wigglewog stole the balloon and left Downfall. She is anxious and depressed that is scheduled for trial by combat the next morning, and is afraid the unjust king will stack the odds against her… When the party reveal that they want to help her, the look on her face shifts, and she reveals:

  
  

Seek Illig, the Baron of Muckstump, to the South, and you will find the answers you seek

  
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdTBJBwNlOmowWbHJG6JiM7ssAGDXTUO5oO1NU1fHXQuVCz4byUPHEGdSxBgTgy1btsj_z6yi2SbCgBt-ltCoNlB8DUYJ72M7CYhnZIn8S4O9I-ivC5af2WTwVJSKxR_axfwrmZMA?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)  

Before leaving, the characters spot a huge storm cloud behind the prison. They investigate it further to find that it is a shop, operated by two darklings, which seems to sell the most foreign but also common trinkets and baubles they could find. Incidentally, the darklings call themselves Trinket and Bauble, and they reveal that their elder, Charm, is currently at Bavlorna’s cottage working out some dealings with her.

The characters, curious about the balloon, convince Trinket and Bauble of revealing its purpose. It is used for travel between the three realms of Prismeer, and they intend to leave soon. Trinket and Bauble get offended at the slurry of questions about the balloon, they remind the characters aggressively that it is not for sale, and point towards a sign that specifies what is for sale.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdcmKSeeON18ZkFuecQDuGjCpbTA9yhRNi0vRovdxelKTienBWkPz1_5lHLqb2Ea12WW5RojLhM2i_ctkl3DyGlPXahNOJyLTxf11jQeVJ-F8OZIy-UO9eKhOVXNHcuZ4zHmsEnrg?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

The price, however, is neither gold nor treasure. Trinket wants to drain the color of one’s eyes, and Bauble wants to take away their ability to dance. Such are the ways of the Feywild.

  
  
  

During this conversation, some members of the party split to ask the guards about Lord Ikrind. A curious Bullywug hermit by the name of Alberto overhears them and decides to join them. They ask Trinket and Bauble a few more questions, specifically with regards to a few individuals they transported from Hither to Tither. They find out that 3 weeks ago, a dwarf, an elf and a tiefling were brought in, but that was all they remembered.

  
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdfGCt6BDNvC4C7GWGT8xdC3WLNcLcKF7b5Sw9RrHdYj25DySRuQRHHqgZ2pf9DTwgBSL3t9qkyb4_UunyNTaiJ9s_kDZ5GewMCfrFeMo04dWUEMCZuPNnPcJNsJ8e31B5Tiweu?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

The party then heads southwards in Downfall to explore the area there. They come across a rotten looking tree with no Bark, guarded by 4 rude and uncouth sprites that constantly insult them and taunt them. Most mostly ignore them, but Ghee makes the effort to flip them off.

Then Alberto guides them towards a shisha lounge that requires 3 fish each to enter for the week; 4 for Doug due to bad negotiation skills.

  
  

Everyone goes fishing afterwards. They use various techniques and methods, from spearfishing, where Argon manages to accidentally stab a Mermaid, to the flying hunter, Ghee, to net fishing, where Doug manages to find a peculiar stone with some exotic inscriptions on it. They all come back with the entrance fee, and then spend most of the evening smoking lemon & mint and twin apple flavored arguiles. Doug manages to speak to the hutkeeper such that they provide them a letter of admittance to Baron Ikrind’s hideout. They then leave and head westward towards the supposed shack where they will meet the Baron of Muckstump.

  

Upon sliding the letter under the door, they are led inside a shady looking hut with 4 knights and the Baron, and then led down into a secret meeting hall housing a couple hundred bullywugs, all discussing preparations for the upcoming coup. Doug uses some of this time to find literature on the stone, and discovers it is nothing but a tablet describing merfolk fish herding. 

  

The party attempts to collectively rouse them up to mount a coup against the hag instead of King Bullog IX, but despite their best efforts, it seems that the rabble is just installing a new monarch instead. Especially since the Baron himself got involved and gave a haughty speech about how ruling is his divine right, enlisting the Hag as said divinity. An hour or so passes and the party gives up and goes to sleep in one of the many dormitories of the underground lair. But an exquisite plan gets hatched to go and kidnap and hide the Baron on that very night. 

The plot succeeds! And everyone wakes up the next day to a missing Baron of Muckstump….

### Day 4

  

The party rally the rabble of Bullywug to grab all their weapons and start marching towards either the stables or the guard tower. Alex Jones’s efforts to convince people that the Baron is locked in the closet are ignored given his tendency to frequently blurt out lies and conspiracy stories. One group of Bullywugs, charged up, rally towards and take over the guard tower. All the guards surrender. The other group takes over the stables and acquires 20 giant frogs which they can use as cavalry.

  

North of the guard tower, hiding behind a tree near the balloon factory, they discover Snailbrain the goblin pirate. They lure the goblin into their revolution with the promise of all the balloons in the factory. 

  

They go further east until they reach the sunken palace, the prison and the fighting pit where they find the knight tied up to a tree and a gorilla about to be unleashed to destroy her. On the way there, a few of the Bullywugs including Alberto stay behind to build a makeshift wooden guillotine, following the blueprints of Alex Jones. The rest get ready for the big epic battle.

  

Details of the battle

  

Meanwhile, Snailbrain gets the rest of the pirate crew and they sneak into the Sunken palace with the hopes of stealing all its treasure. Alberto joins them on their way to the palace but stands against the pirates when he discovers their plan to sack the palace. The pirate captain threatens Alberto and all the other opposing Bullywug with his gun. They take all the treasure and prepare to leave. However, one Owly spots them on their way back, commissioned by Ghee, who through Owly breathes acid onto their sails in an effort to stop them. The pirate ship stops in place, and after a while when all the Bullywugsmake their way to the hag, the pirates pack up all the treasure they can and attempt an escape with a nearby balloon made of clouds. 6 pirates are left behind, including Snailbrain, and they are instructed to find other balloons to make their way out of Hither.

  

The victorious Bullywugs celebrate by beheading the king using their brand new king killing machine. However, their uproar is cut short , as a huge swarm of lornlings, tiny replicas of Bavlorna, start emerging from the lake. There are hundreds of them, and they are shortly followed by the Hag herself. She begins speaking to everyone in a loud, grisly voice.

  

A certain rabbit person with a weird name amongst the crowd shrieks “Ewww!!!” upon confronting her hideous visage. With the flick of her hand, the hag sows the mouth of the long named rabbit shut. 

Her speech is further interrupted by Alberto, who manages to dodge the mouth sowing spell. but is then immediately hit with a deadly cast of 12 magic missiles and falls unconscious. 

  

The hag continues her speech and she is not happy. She tells the Bullywugs to pick a new king by tomorrow, or else. Alex Jones, with his relentlessly persuasive charms, suggest that the hag invites the new king into her residence for a royal crowning, to which she acknowledges and reminds everyone that this is indeed the procession she requires.

  

Goals:

- Form and elect a political bureau
    
- Get into the hag’s lair
    

  

Later on, during the long silence and turmoil after the hag’s departure, the party gathers together with the bullywugs and tries to convince them to elect Altberto as fake king in order to gain entrance to the Hag’s lair. They hold inspiring speeches and try to hide the fact that Alberto looks very beaten down and barely standing up. Duke Ikrind comes up on stage, piercing through the illusion cast by the party of Alberto, remaining silent. They tell the duke about their plan, to which he agrees but is sceptical of. The discussion dies down and everyone sets up camp, ready to rest before tomorrow’s election.

  

Meanwhile, Snailbrain joins the party again, and tells them about her visit to the hag’s lair. Bavlorna introduced her to Charm, a tall Darkling lady that is a friend of hers, and they make Snailbrain an offer, in exchange for the soul of her captain she would receive a balloon. 

  

Meanwhile Alex Jones and Argon gather up all the radical Bullywugs and found the RAF. At night when everyone is resting, they fly towards the sunken palace, following the reports from their comrades that it’s being attacked by lornlings. They find pirates hiding in the palace, trying to fight off a horde of lornlings. They help the pirate crew and manage to save 8 of them, upheaving them into the balloon they came here in. Sadly, during the ordeal, the captain dies, gutted by a lornling as both Alex Jones and Argon carried him flying out of the scene. They return to the party, who had woken up due to a loud thunder sound. 

  

Snailbrain is devastated to hear about what happened to her crew and her captain. She is determined to slay the hag and help the party, despite the unfriendly comments from a butthurt Alberto.

### Day 5

The next morning, Snailbrain decides to return to the hag, and she is accompanied by Alberto to aid her in crossing the dangerous pond. She is able to enter the tea room of the hag, whilst Alberto is stopped by a sort of barrier at the foot of the cottage, seemingly erected to keep out bullywugs. Snailbrain is greeted by Charm and Bavlorna. Charm tells her that she lied to her, and it was her doing to unleash the lornlings on the pirate crew. 

  

During this ordeal, Argon and Wargrat follow her, but as Argon couldn’t carry Wiggywog he decides to swim. To his surprise, a force pulls him underwater and he wakes up at a dark cave underwater. He lights up the area with a spell and discovers symbols on the cave walls, but can’t make sense of them. He then manages to find a way out by swimming through and ends up in front of the hag’s lair.

  

The hag tells Snailbrain that she likes her and the deal is still on, but she wants the captain’s body if not his soul. Snailbrain tells her that the body is burned as part of the pirate burial ritual. The hag then tells her that if she doesn’t have anything to bargain with, it doesn’t look too good for her. She excuses herself to smoke on the balcony and sees Argon, who flies back to their camp with Argon, sensing danger. 

  

Weegwoo discovews a waiting Awbewto and twies to convince him to get back. After receiving a message via Alex Jones from Snailbrain, he realizes that Snailbrain is already gone so they swim back to shore of camp for the election.

  

The party spends a while discussing how to move forward with the election. They decide to ask the Knight, Sir Morgort, that they had saved from execution about how to enter the hags lair, given that she had prior experience with that, and given that the only party member who did that so far was Snailbrain. She describes an entry from the bottom of her house through her pool, below the waters, where a certain Gelatinous cube lies, clogging the pipe to the Hag’s lair. 

  

The party concocts a plot to lure the cube away with some brine and swim up the tube, or at the very least for Alberto to enter.

  

They all succeed, and make it inside, where they find themselves in a main entrance chamber with several other connected rooms and a pool (B1) in the middle. Exploring the rest of the first floor, they enter through the leftmost door, and find a room (B2) filled with taxidermied animals that seem to be combinations of different animals sewn together.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeAXPokrnAsyYHIj7CL0GZHijYPvbmhA3iYjqAPGCW1tmJwbVdwIkEZm-R2nOgoD3OXdAY_KBfwjG41WgKiXZ1eY4wxBOfNgCvvoe0rVq21OMhYsIUqdXXZ-b2wZWU3by5lZHnl?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

Moving on, they enter a small fabric closet (B3) where they find two dolls with several pins stitched onto them.

  

Alberto checks out the stairs (B4) and finds a wasp nest among them. Him and Argon carefully climb up and reach the next floor, where they enter what seems to be a meat locker in a frozen room (B12). There they find a chest with a beating heart in it and take it, surmising it is probably the heart of the elf Octavian.

  

Meanwhile, Doug explores a cupboard room (B5) where he finds an hourglass handle. Upon turning the handle, it drops a small scrap of paper with the words “spittlestew” written on it.

Upon returning from the meat locker, Alberto glides over to the balcony (B6) where he finds a bunch of resting frogs. He decides to speak to them, to which they react with panicked croaking. Shortly afterwards, a Lornling appears from the spiral staircase of the mainroom, and informs the rest of the party that Bavlorna would like to invite them for a cup of tea.

  
  

The lornling guides them upstairs, through a corridor (B9) full of erroneous paintings, and into a tall wide living room (B10) where the Bavlorna and Charm seem to be having tea. The Hag takes a piece of hair from everyone shortly after entry (except for Ghee, who threatens retaliation), and she uses it to somehow infer information from each strand. 

She asks Argon if he wants to find his real family, Alex Jones if he wants to start a real revolution and she turns to Doug and tells him that the beast he’s looking for is here.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcy1fkTlJHnTkLsCPY3WfJmESI383DqFRTLBUFK2TwTTQPti7Q9uBf9HVxUO2tN-uiOALPVYRIbjs4XV-s4wbgbpuSzUhTaLvPW_6dG1a6B9vuah9qD4pYycYrvV0JZX0RZDMxsvA?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

For all of these… services, she offers them a deal:

Help unclog her pool, help her retrieve the ship the pirates stole and find her book of sworn enemies.

Ghee tries to leave sneakly but failsand is spotted, however Bavlorna doesn’t seem to care. This is when Ghee notices a pair of red eyes in the corner of the room behind the cupboard and a small group of lornlings well hidden across the room. They also notice that the furniture in the room seems to be animated. 

  

The conversation concludes with the Hag telling everyone to think about her deal, and then offers them the dining room (B16) across the corridor to rest. The party moves on to there, and upon inspecting the room, find two lornlings spying on them and chase them away. 

  

They then start exploring other rooms. First they go south and find a distillery (B17), where alcohol is being made. Ghee figures out that it’s a highly flammable type of alcohol named “hooch” which explodes upon being thrown, dealing 3d6 fire damage in a 2m diameter on impact. They take six bottles, shared with Alex Jones.

  

The next room is a butcher’s kitchen (B13), where they find a redcap butcher. They talk to her and find out that she’s very grumpy and hates Bavlorna, because she mistreats her and asks it to do things it doesn’t want. With a bit of charm and a silk tongue, Alex Jones finds out through the redcap that the hag's biggest weakness is that if they run around in circles, she starts sneezing uncontrollably. 

  

After that they thank the butcher and go to the balcony (B14). There, perched inside one of the cages, is a nonchalant Satyr, enjoying the sun inside a cage. He introduces himself as Vansel, and kindly asks the party to let them out. Doug opens the cage by force, and Vansel rewards him and the other two who were nice to them each with a stick of luck (+1 to roll once a day).

  

The party then makes it inside a pantry (B15) area, where they find several jars full of seemingly dead herbs, vegetables, mushrooms, organs and sometimes even creatures. Nothing of value is found there, so they just leave.

  

Afterwards, the party circles back into the tea room, but they find no one there… in fact, it seems that the room was cleared in a hurry, and the pitter patter of several creatures can be heard from the ceiling…

  
  

Goals:

- Defeat the black harngon
    

  
  

The party decides to go up and investigate the footsteps. All go up except Argon, who stays down and investigates the tearoom. 

He first searches the couch for leftover coin, but instead, his hand gets stuck and it seems like the couch’s creases form a smile, as if it was… mocking him. Argon then proceeds to stab the couch, initiating combat with it. After a gruesome fight, he beats it, finding no gold or silver between the cushions. So he goes to the potion cabinet, lockpicks it open and takes the three potions he finds, not knowing what they are as the labels on them seem to be some kind of Elvish. At the top of the cabinet an inanimate stuffed cat turns into life and attacks him! A fight ensues between him and the cat, where every time he stabs it, it turns into a puff of smoke but comes back to life again, then tries to grapple Argon.

  

In the meantime, upstairs, Alex Jones, Doug and Alberto as they enter what seems to be the hag’s dilapidated bedroom. They spot a magical source of light on top, some drawers, a big locked chest and a bed made of straw… with two red eyes piercing from underneath it. The hag stands firmly on one corner of the bedroom, whilst Charm and her two darklings on the other side, there seems to be tension…

  

The hag accuses Charm of trying to enter her secret room and open her secret chest. Charm denies it and tells Bavlorna to calm down, but she’s really on edge herself; this back and forth goes on for a while. During the debacle, Doug and Alex Jones both notice that Charm has no shadow. Alex Jones directly confronts her about it, which causes Charm to look around in a panic, screaming “Alright let’s go!”. Suddenly a secret door breaks open and a shadow carrying a chest enters the room! 

  

Combat starts, but it’s just between Charm, Trinket, Bauble, Bavlorna and her hidden allies... A black harengon black harengon suddenly pops out from under the bed, and causes a shockwave to ripple through Charm, Trinket and Bauble, the latter two dying instantly from the hit. Charm, heavily damaged, merges with her shadow and jumps out of the window with the chest, yelling out “So long suckeeeeeers” on her way down.

  

In a split moment, Alex Jones, overtaken by a desire for revenge against the black harengon, attacks it, causing combat to shift to between the party and the hag and her allies. Everyone starts attacking the hag, Alberto specifically runs around in circles counter clockwise around her, causing her to sneeze, but the hag has a lot of tricks up her sleeve... First thing she does is to call all her lornlings to come aid her. Hundreds of lornlings appear outside of the building and try to enter the room through the windows, which prompts the party to try and close the windows, fight the hag and kill the black harengon.

  

The hag then swallows Alberto whole!

Meanwhile, the party doesn’t try turning around her again, but still manages to kill the black herangon. Then Argon runs up and joins them, a stuffed animated cat attacking him, which he promptly throws out the window.

  

The battle upstairs is intense, and the party almost kills the hag, but she casts polymorph on herself and turns into a goose hydra with five heads at the last second. Every time the party cuts off a head, two new ones pop up, and so she starts spreading her attacks on each party member, with one attack per head. 

  

She then goes to the center of the room and performs a loud call at the lornlings, at which point they stop pouring into the room. After a few turns, the lornlings have detached the four ropes that tie the hag’s house into the soil, and the whole cottage starts flying off! It seems its attached to fabric woven at the top of the cottage. 

  

The whole party is now very confused, do they stay in the balloon and fight her or jump off? 

  

Bavlorna uses that opportunity to jump down through a hole in the cottage that Alex Jones’ shatter tore through, until she reaches her pool at the entrance and turns back into her regular form; it seems she is starting to rejuvenate. 

  

The party can’t reach her in time and she heals a lot of health. 

  

Doug makes it down and tries to use his frog Frederiko to push her out of the water so she doesn’t heal, but that doesn’t work. They all desperately try to finish her off, standing and fighting on their last leg…

  

At the very end, they’re all about to fall unconscious, but the hag is very close to death, despite rejuvenating actively in the pool. They all try to hit her and miss, Alex Jones casts shatter at her and breaks the floor of her pool, causing her to plummet into the swamp.The party loses hope… with no one able to finish her off but Argon, he uses his off hand to throw his dagger at her… A risky attempt, but a successful one! With a swift throw, he pierces her skull with the dagger as she falls. Rays of dark light gather unto her falling corpse, and within moments, it explodes into nothing! Simultaneously, all of the lornlings inflate and pop into puffs of swamp gas, which unfortunately goes up and fully inflates the balloon lifting up the former hag’s cottage. 

  

Immediately afterwards, Doug, Argon and Alberto jump off into the lake. Alex Jones meanwhile starts looting the house. He only focuses on the last floor, and starts throwing everything he cannot open down into the lake. He throws the big chest in the bedroom first, then he explores the secret room, figures out that the light was a willow wisp then, finds a bunch of junk, mainly toys, musical instruments, a bagpipe (which he takes), a mannequin with a magical helm on top a stag’s head, and a giant bronze frog statue with pure darkness emanating from inside his open mouth. He investigates the stag’s head and finds it to be an illusion; it’s actually a scarecrow’s head! He realizes this might be Clapperclaw’s. Then, he investigates further by putting his head inside the giant frog statue’s mouth, but feels nothing, as if it’s like a giant sea of darkness. He decides to shrink the statue and throw it out the balcony. With the mannequin, he notices that every time he takes off its helmet, it grabs it and puts it back on. After a small round of miming gestures, he cleverly removes the helmet and puts a hat instead, which the mannequin appreciates, and then flies out back down into the swamp.

  

After this ordeal, the frog sinks to the bottom of the water but the chest floats. Doug uses that opportunity to send Frederiko to recover the frog. He offers the merfolk one of their stones, and they return the favor by bringing the statue onto the shore. 

  

In the meantime, Alberto opens the chest with a lockpick and he finds a 12 inch tall marionette with two faces on the opposite sides of their heads, one face, clad in silver, looks like the moon, the other, clad in gold, the sun. Both sides connect to the wooden marionette with obsidian. He also finds an unpunched ticket from the witchlight carnival, but it’s unusual, unlike the carnival the party remembers. Doug finally pulls three spell scrolls of identity from the chest, and proceeds to go to shore and start investigating the bronze frog. Meanwhile, Alex Jones finds out that it’s a cursed wishing well. You put your hand inside, tell it what you want, and it gives it to you but takes something else. The party leaves it there, but the Bullywugs take notice of it and start worshiping it…

  

The party then takes the head of the scarecrow to Clapperclaw. The moment they place it on his head, he turns into a real human boy. He can’t believe it! The last thing he remembers is traveling with his family and being attacked, then killed by bandits on the road. He remembers his soul going through the hells before being snatched out of there and put in the body of a scarecrow. He forgot all these when he was a scarecrow, but now with his head returned, he suddenly remembers. His real name was Jimmy. 

  

They find out while talking to the Bullywugs that Charm escaped with her balloon. And he reveals that actually there are rumors that Charm is working for Scabatha Nightshade, the oldest hag among the coven.

  

Jimmy talks a bit about Scabatha and about Tither, where it’s very forestry and gloomy. He talks about a well known legend about Bavlorna stealing Scabatha’s thread of puppet making. Alex Jones asks Jimmy, has he ever gone to the Witchlight Carnival, he says yes but it was a dark and somber place…

Everyone, exhausted and tired, rests for the day, enjoying the liberation of Hither.

### Day 6

Everyone wakes up to a greener, happier, brighter Hither. The grass is greener, the waters less murky, the animals cherrier, the mushrooms look brighter, the swamp is less swampy. One may even spot merfolk swimming across downfall’s lake.

Everyone spends the day working on their own hobbies and interests, enjoying their well deserved rest.

  

Ghee studies the various books of nature found in the bullywugs libraries; Wigglit finds a small pet rabbit and teaches it a few tricks. Meanwhile, Argon and Alberto speak to the leathersmith of Downfall and attempt to forge some better armor for him, with no success unfortunately, as he only works with frog leather. Alex Jones goes to Jingle Jangle and catches up. Doug spends the day working on the snake teeth into a lance, but damages it in the process, so he proceeds with reading a few fey poetry books from the library instead.

### Day 7-12

The next week, the party spends their time repairing the balloon, fusing it with the broken one to form a bigger flying ship and install a ballista on it. They also loot the bandit’s tollway, which they found full of overgrowth and animal skeletons, with Alberto failing to remove the giant snake’s teeth. Argon and him beforehand have also looted the lake and found a special frog leather armor under the lake, and the skeleton of a weird creature at the bottom. Ghee creates a small device that can recreate a hawk’s squawking upon being pressed.

  

### Day 13

The party spends the day researching how to create a rudder and giant hamster wheel system on the ship, but only Ghee is able to find two books, one book for the science behind boat rudders and another general how to book for balloon handling and construction.

  

### Day 14

After a few hours of travel to Tither, the party arrives in a realm full of fog and smog, they can barely see beyond a few feet. Ghee flies up very far, to try and take a better look, they have a decent bird’s view of Tither, but the information provided is quite limited…

  
![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdWSNpco9x3amkAUV0TzgPAmEJwk3TQ4UlDlWe0CDNZOtVH8wYWN11pU1A2eFCAY71mJkUVVSjpx7ZLY8W3IkDd4qpBjhJJqYXeaEhS8ZyyISw25RPt274YTpaqVKfYVp2ifXLY?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

They glance at a view of the realm, covered by fog and forests. They see a large river, being fed by several small rivers, and finally merging into a lake. They see mountains and hills of yellow sandstone and clay, the westward ones pertaining a darker color than those eastward.

  

Ghee flies back down, and tells the party where they are, the foot of the river south east. They spot a small village in the distance, with tall mounted silhouettes, and they all then decide to head there and find out what it is. 

  

To their surprise, the creatures were not mounted at all. In fact, they were centaurs, forming a primitive centaur village, and a modest and crude one at that. There are nothing but basic hovels and longhouses, their rooftops made of straw. 

A wooden palisade surrounds the village, with two main entrances carved out in the east and west side. Around it is nothing but steppes and lightly forested plains.

  

Greeting the party at first with spears and arrows pointed at them, the centaurs lower their guard and welcome everyone in when they spot Jimmy.

  

The party is led inside and guided towards the main longhouse, where they meet the chief. A black furred centaur with a golden mane. He is armed with a well decorated longbow and a sturdy but beautiful spear. Introducing himself as Goliolatrix, the centaur welcomes the party and Jimmy, and invites them all to rest and dine with them.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdO5fQYMFZdTO1_zUQZdVcFbNFKcc7E5zt926pOAssqGlXKkSB2ayTtyeWxCmuwUSxRe3t6Xy07N2Bp9ywalSFS5EYxx5oz8Mq4lHSy6oaT6HL4CkHY71xauty_8vL4LHVGru4snA?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

As the night befalls Tither, the centaurs hold a feast in the honor of their new friends, and tales are exchanged about the situation of the land: 

  

We have fled our former homes in the wilderness and banded together to form this shabby but defensible village near the river. We had no choice, hunted to death or slavery by the Hag’s minions, hordes of tin soldiers guided by malicious redcaps chased us day and night from the forests to the west. Those centaurs who lived east had all been killed or captured save but a few, only one of which made it here.

  

Upon hearing this, the party inquires further about the surviving centaur. Goliolatrix takes them aside to introduce them. In a corner of the longhouse lies a heavily scarred, battle worn creature, watching the feast with a sense of sorrow. She is hailed as Boudia, and she explains her situation, where she came from, and how she narrowly escaped death.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcNdXpeIjtV735WsYQp6bBx8jwJK91hNEKyOAoWUA4mcUK3EWF8hxnjVvtFJd_8GnrZC-yOR0BUVqioR39dtfKYz3tfXfeYbahLS9j9GAKAmG26-E70iFXt7eLB29806RM8OpeqPg?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

I hail far to the north west of here, from a humble village nestled between two rivers and a series of hills and small mountains. We had all heard of the Hags taking over Prismeer but we never thought anything of it, for our kind had lived here for centuries, peacefully living off the land and giving back to it. One dark night, whilst I was out hunting, I came back to my village in flames. They were everywhere, the tin soldiers and their redcap lieutenants, with torches, swords and javelins in hand. I barely escaped capture, powering through their blows and projectiles, and running endlessly across the forests, all night, until I reached these plains. Goliolatrix’s centaurs soon found me and brought me in to heal and recover.

  

The party learns from Boudia as much as they can. They find out that the Tin men, who fight with spears and javelins, have trouble fighting without the guidance of the redcaps, who fight with their scythes and some basic magic. 

  

Tired and battered from the long journey, and their bellies full from the feast, everyone rests for the night.

### Day 15

The next day the party talks to Goliolatrix to try and figure out a way to keep the balloon in town. He refuses to leave it inflated and in the village, as it would draw the attention of the hag’s soldiers. After some wacky plans, some including digging a hole, others deflating it, they decide to go and leave it near the river entrance where the fog is thickest.

  

After that, the party makes it clear that they will travel westward, to try to find and unearth the burnt village, and find out more about the Skabatha’s hordes in Tither. Upon hearing this, Boudia asks to join them in their travels; she wishes to bury, honor and avenge her kin…![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe2f4mVY_wDeph__XfKBFMru1q_o6FXMz2XpxCQDCrT8osKfRPxKDQbIIJMQiOG08WtvTNuFWnb3jqy4Pr8ENUaMDzpT3UJzYI0l-VWmZCydxUzhWkIbSOSAXdrMLbk4EmIh8r0KA?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

They depart shortly after dawn towards the west, traveling straight along the plains for the better half of the day, until they reach the river. There they find a group of wild dogs huddled together, howling at a shallow hole in the ground. As the party approaches they notice two striking details. First, Ghee identifies the dogs as Blink dogs, magical hounds who can blink in and out of reality on a whim; and second, the dogs seem to be howling around the corpse of one of their dead, a javelin stuck to his back. 

  

The party offers them food, and tries to communicate with the dogs, who seem to understand Sylvan, but not speak it! They use gestures and a drawing of a cross in the dirt to warn the party of what hurt them.

After a small while, everyone leaves them to their ritual, and follows the river south towards where the forestland is becoming more and more lush with trees and vegetation.

Before they leave, they spot Boudia talking to the dogs, guiding them eastward, probably towards the centaur village for protection.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdhRz_B3O3VqLmPjcesD9iiA2Z-bLsvm8U3JJSXMTuE5bkhwYUDEgM1KMVggO7I2IHaUI4mxmndZiEXe87g9Ig7m5vHLBcb3QPzu_P1CcSDdqXo31mvW56qJEm_mb8odgb3pKVMbg?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

Reaching the river’s mouth, in the middle of the forest, as the moon hangs high in the sky, everyone decides to stop for the night and set up camp. But they unfortunately do not have the chance to fully rest, as in the middle of their labor they are ambushed by a group of dryads. The lead one, angry and bitter, points her finger at the party and yells in a gritty, bark-infested voice:

  

Slay the corrupted ones!

  

Her and the other 4 dryads awaken some 9 shrubs, which collectively attack the party. As the fight rages on, the lead dryad pulls out a bow made of a shiny black stone, and arrows with similar arrowheads. She hits Alex Jones with one, which curses him and withers away part of his life essence.

The party manages to slay the dryads, take the bow, and move elsewhere in the forest to avoid an ambush. They rest for the night, setting up camp a bit more west than before. Their sentries spot a few pairs of red eyes in the darkness, but ultimately ignore them and proceed with their night’s sleep.

### Day 16

The next day, everyone moves west towards the huge mountain. Right before its foot, they encounter a fairy circle around an old withering oak tree, and the fairies within start playing pranks on them, entangling them and silencing them. However, Alex Jones finds a great deal of kinship with those fairies, and they share a lot of conspiracy theories together. 

  

As the encounter drags on, the fairies divulge a lot of information about themselves. They were captured and escaped Skabatha’s factories, where they were used for their fairy dust to animate the tin soldiers. Imprisoned and enslaved for months on end, the fairies turned malicious, and apparently purple…

  

Using some reflective words, Boudia manages to convince some of them to renounce their mischievous ways. Those who do turn a bright green, in stark contrast to the dark purple they used to sparkle with.

  

The recently good turned fairies then decide to follow the party, after some brief convincing, to the west towards the mountain, where they intend to ambush and free a centaur pack mule supposedly carrying up the mountain.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf_IOpvGq6Y1vrGFBxXDxLauZ2WcAsBaSOGHvsw1Ntum-OlkUnjtLrGEmyZn7fl2Kt8QgiHo4vnERhdQxI1YP9APKYHpJLFMsVpvllUzO8hwQM_ybAR9dKoqkqPpvRFTDDZikqFmg?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  

The party then ventures into the foot of the mountain and spends a small while scaling it, following one of the three main roads. Surprise! They get ambushed by a Redcap who taunts them from a higher elevation on the road of the mountain. He declares:

  
  

In the name of Skabatha Nightshade, you are all placed under arrest! Surrender your weapons.

  

Wigglit immediately uses this opportunity to cast chaos bolt on the Redcap, starting combat with it. This of course trigger’s his Wild Magic, which causes him to grow one size into large. A group of tin soldiers suddenly arise from the edges of the mountain pass and throw javelins at everyone, causing significant damage, but not before the party dispatches the redcap with ease.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcbufariV8KLatp1yCdGz5LCoXkGmoFCYXix6Nmta7ZZp7QolVTmaYWOvvD-N02zLJFSLwhYs_rn132mq68F2olOmlS8t9VtP1kk_6JodL_xSC-WZOZzbIgXMmjnFwHM_q5kIn8_w?key=btPPWRUMplLSGJMyNYu39f7g)

  
  

This seems to cause a significant amount of confusion amongst the tin soldiers, and they seemingly ignore the whole party and only try to attack Argon! They even knock him out and start carrying him, completely ignoring blows and attacks from the rest of the party during the process!

  

With relative ease, the tin soldiers are dispatched and cut to pieces, and argon brought back to health. Everyone decides to rest for a short while before adventuring further up the mountain. Alberto even sneaks ahead to scout and identify if there are any more ambushers up the trail. He finds 2 in a mere 20 minute hike, at approximately 500 m of altitude, leading him to believe there must be many more to come as they trek their way up…

Ghee and Dial up scout up the mountain and dispatch several small guarrissons of tin soldiers and recaps, until they reach a flat plateau with a dark narrow cave. The whole party gathers there and scouts around the cave, they notice at the peak of the mountain where the cave is, lies a scarecrow. Alex Jones and Argon take out the scarecrow and retrieve the gems of his eyes, which they notice are made of the same dark obsidian that they found earlier. Scouting further into the dark cave the party notices that at the end, at the next opening, is a large redcap and tin soldier guarisson.

  

The party sets a plan to ambush them, with Alex Jones trying to trigger a rock slide with shatter and the rest of the party rushing out to fight. Unfortunately, the plan goes awry, and the initial shatter from Alex Jones was not enough to cause the stones to fall. He is hit with a barrage of javelins that cause him to collapse on the ground dead!

  

A fight ensues afterwards, where the party retreats to the plateau and takes on several redcaps on giant bats and tin soldiers. This distraction was enough for Skathach to escape her cage in the redcap camp… The party manages to dispatch all the redcaps and tin soldiers, but not before one escapes on a giant bat!

  

Skathach then escapes down the mountain and reaches a formerly dispatched encampment, and then scavenges some of the remnants of the camp.

  

The group proceeds up towards the mountain, dispatching more and more tin soldiers and redcap garrisons until they reach the mountain peak, where they find a huge cave illuminated on the inside. Dial Up/Argon (?)  uses his powers of invisibility to sneak through the two tin soldiers guarding the entrance and encounters a blindfolded old man inside a huge cave, well illuminated and filled with deactivated tin soldiers. There is a massive pile of gold he is overseeing, and a desk table with what seems to be a big ledger in front of him. Behind the old man is a door, slightly ajar, which shows a lightly illuminated room with a bed inside.

  

The man, despite his blindfold and Dial Up’s invisibility, seems to be able to see him. It did not take long until he started speaking to him. They spoke briefly about themselves, and then the man told he is known as Gib… and he was tricked by the hag to guard and count the gold in this room. He did not seem hostile but warned Dial Up about robbing him. It seemed to the party that this man was somehow connected to the Hag and to Baldur’s Gate, as he said he used to be a person of interest there, and had to leave suddenly.

  

After a while, everyone went back down from the mountain and they met the escaped Skathach on the way. She introduced herself and offered to join them.

  

It did not take them long until they talked to each other and decided to go North, towards her village and towards Boudia’s former home.

  

They soon encountered another Oak tree, withered and filled with purple fairies. There, they spoke to the fairies and played with them, but not before the fairies pulled a significant amount of pranks and mischiefs on the party. Ghee resummoned Owlie as a giant chicken and pulled a small performance for the fairies, Skathach also did a puppet show to the fairies, which all helped turn them green.

  

Ghee, who is generally passionate about observing creatures and writing down their physiology and unique behaviors, noticed oddly that the fairies are not actually purple, but rather have a dark obsidian shine to them. When they asked them about it, the fairies replied that this was always their nature.

  

At the end of Ghee’s giant chicken performance, they make their familiar breath fire whilst flying up, which prompts the fairies to point and yell “Oh its Zhengyi! It’s Zhengyi”. The party asks them who that was, and they reply that it is the most ancient beast god that inhabits this realm, sleeping far far up in the floating mountains in the east.

  

The party then goes back to rest, and shares stories and… nude paintings with each other.

### Day 17

The next day, the party goes further north until they reach a large set of hills nestled between two river beds. There, they noticed that the terrain is all burnt and ashen, and the trees are all cut down! Ghee resummons Owlie and sends it over to explore the hills, and they find that there are 5 factories nestled among them.4 smaller ones, each on a certain periphery, and one large central factory in the middle. Owlie scouts the larger factory and sees that it is right next to what seems to be a Tin deposit, and the insides of the factories are filled with slaves, redcaps overseers and assembly lines for what seems to be Tin soldiers…

  

The party then decides to skirt the charred and cut down areas of the hilly terrain, hiding behind the trees, until they find a group of redcaps and slaves that are cutting down trees at the edge of the forest. The party decided to try and kill the redcaps and free the slaves, so they hid behind some of the trees and prepared for an ambush…
