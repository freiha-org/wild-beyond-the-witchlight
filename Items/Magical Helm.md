# Magical Helm

A magical helmet found on a mannequin in [[Bavlorna's Cottage]]'s secret room.

**Description:** The helm was on top of a stag's head, which was actually an illusion hiding [[Clapperclaw]]'s real scarecrow head.

The mannequin would grab the helmet and put it back on whenever it was removed. [[Alex Jones]] cleverly removed it by putting a hat on the mannequin instead, which it appreciated.

**Found by:** [[Alex Jones]]
