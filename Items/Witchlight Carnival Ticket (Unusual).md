# Witchlight Carnival Ticket (Unusual)

An unpunched ticket from the [[Witchlight Carnival]], but unlike the carnival the party remembers.

**Description:** This ticket appears to be from a different, darker version of the carnival. [[Jimmy]] mentioned that when he visited the Witchlight Carnival, it was a dark and somber place.

**Found in:** The locked chest in [[Bavlorna's Cottage]] after the hag's defeat
