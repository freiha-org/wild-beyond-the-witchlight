# Bronze Frog Statue (Cursed Wishing Well)

A giant bronze frog statue with pure darkness emanating from inside its open mouth.

**Effect:** A cursed wishing well. You put your hand inside, tell it what you want, and it gives it to you but takes something else in return.

**Found at:** [[Bavlorna's Cottage]] secret room
**Discovered by:** [[Alex Jones]] - shrank the statue and threw it out the balcony

[[Doug]] sent [[Frederiko]] to recover the frog from the lake. The merfolk brought the statue to shore in exchange for one of their stones.

The party left it on shore, where the Bullywugs took notice and started worshipping it.

**Current Location:** [[Downfall]] (being worshipped by Bullywugs)
